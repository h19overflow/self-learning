# ABSTRACT

An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pretraining on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example – deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pretrained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than finetuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Many applications in natural language processing rely on adapting one large-scale, pre-trained language model to multiple downstream applications. Such adaptation is usually done via fine-tuning, which updates all the parameters of the pre-trained model. The major downside of fine-tuning is that the new model contains as many parameters as in the original model. As larger models are trained every few months, this changes from a mere “inconvenience” for GPT-2 (Radford et al., b) or RoBERTa large (Liu et al., 2019) to a critical deployment challenge for GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) with 175 billion trainable parameters.1

Many sought to mitigate this by adapting only some parameters or learning external modules for new tasks. This way, we only need to store and load a small number of task-specific parameters in addition to the pre-trained model for each task, greatly boosting the operational efficiency when deployed. However, existing techniques often introduce inference latency (Houlsby et al., 2019; Rebuffi et al., 2017) by extending model depth or reduce the model’s usable sequence length (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021) (Section 3). More importantly, these method often fail to match the fine-tuning baselines, posing a trade-off between efficiency and model quality.

**Conceptual Understanding:**
This image conceptually represents a reparametrization strategy within a machine learning or neural network model. The main purpose is to visually explain how a model's output `h` is derived from an input `x` by combining a fixed component (Pretrained Weights `W`) with two trainable components (`A` and `B`). The key idea being communicated is the decomposition of a model's parameters into a static, pre-learned part and dynamic, learnable adjustments, enabling efficient and targeted training by focusing only on specific components (`A` and `B`) while leveraging existing knowledge in `W`.

**Content Interpretation:**
This image illustrates a reparametrization scheme for a machine learning model. It depicts how an input 'x' is transformed into an output 'h' through a combination of pretrained, fixed weights and newly introduced trainable components. The core components are 'Pretrained Weights W ∈ ℝᵈˣᵈ', which are fixed, and two additional components 'B = 0' and 'A = N(0, σ²)' that are explicitly designed to be trainable. The input 'x' (with dimension 'd') feeds into both the 'Pretrained Weights' and 'A'. The output of 'Pretrained Weights' is added to the output of 'B=0' via a '+' operation to produce the final output 'h'. The component 'A' is initialized from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance σ², and is associated with a label 'r'. The component 'B' is initialized to 0. This setup demonstrates a way to adapt a model by only training a subset of parameters, leveraging existing pretrained knowledge while allowing for flexible adjustments.

**Key Insights:**
**Main Takeaways/Lessons:**
1.  **Reparameterization Strategy:** The diagram illustrates a method to reparameterize a model's transformation by separating fixed, pretrained knowledge (`W`) from adjustable, trainable components (`A` and `B`). This is beneficial for transfer learning or fine-tuning, allowing models to adapt without re-training all parameters.
2.  **Targeted Training:** The explicit labeling of `W` as "Pretrained Weights" and the external context stating "We only train A and B" highlight a strategy of targeted training. This suggests an approach to optimize efficiency by reducing the number of trainable parameters or to mitigate issues like catastrophic forgetting in transfer learning.
3.  **Importance of Initialization:** The specific initialization schemes for `B` (`B = 0`) and `A` (`A = N(0, σ²)`) are shown, emphasizing that the starting values of trainable parameters are critical for model convergence and performance.

**Conclusions/Insights:**
*   The architecture proposes a way to incrementally learn new information or adapt a model by adding a learnable adjustment to a fixed, pretrained base, rather than modifying the entire weight matrix directly.
*   The decomposition into `W`, `A`, and `B` effectively allows for a more controlled and potentially stable learning process, building upon established knowledge.
*   The labels `d` for input `x` and `r` for component `A` suggest potential roles in dimensionality specification or rank-based operations within the reparametrization scheme, implying structured adjustments.

**Document Context:**
This image directly supports the document's introduction of a "reparametrization" technique. The accompanying text, "Figure 1: Our reparametrization. We only train A and B.", clearly states the purpose of the diagram. It serves as a visual explanation of how the authors decompose the model's parameters into fixed (pretrained) and trainable components. By showing 'W' as 'Pretrained Weights' and initializing 'B' to 0 and 'A' to N(0, σ²), it concretely illustrates which parts are being referred to as 'A' and 'B' that are subject to training, and how they integrate with the fixed 'W' to form the overall transformation from 'x' to 'h'. This visual breakdown is crucial for understanding the foundational architectural choice made by the authors.

**Summary:**
This diagram, titled "Our reparametrization," illustrates a model architecture designed to leverage "Pretrained Weights" while introducing specific trainable components. The entire system takes an input labeled `x`, which has a dimension `d` as indicated by the bracket below it, and produces an output labeled `h`. The process begins with the input `x` being fed into two parallel pathways. In the first pathway, `x` interacts with a blue square component labeled "Pretrained Weights," further specified as the matrix "W ∈ ℝᵈˣᵈ". This signifies a fixed set of weights, likely learned from a previous task or a larger dataset, that are not updated during the current training phase. The output from these "Pretrained Weights" then flows upwards towards a summation point indicated by a "+" sign. In the second pathway, `x` also interacts with an orange trapezoidal component labeled "A = N(0, σ²)". This means that this component's parameters, associated with a label `r` indicated by a bracket above it, are initialized from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a variance of σ². This component, along with another orange trapezoidal component labeled "B = 0" (meaning its parameters are initialized to zero), constitutes the trainable parts of the model, as explicitly stated in the document context "We only train A and B". The output from the "Pretrained Weights" component and the "B = 0" component are then combined through an addition operation, represented by the "+" symbol. The final result of this addition is the output `h`. In essence, the diagram shows a system where the output `h` is constructed by taking the output of a fixed, pretrained transformation (`W` acting on `x`) and adding a learnable adjustment. This adjustment is composed of two parts: `B`, which starts at zero, and `A`, which is initialized stochastically and also takes `x` as an input. This reparametrization allows the model to adapt to new tasks or data by only training `A` and `B`, effectively fine-tuning the pretrained capabilities without altering the core `W` knowledge. The labels `d` and `r` likely refer to specific dimensions relevant to the input `x` and the `A` component, respectively, further defining the structural properties of this reparametrization.](images/c6cd11a2fab59d0ae910b96bf2196a72f4911febc66bf6d9fced07409078d2a2.jpg)
Figure 1: Our reparametrization. We only train $A$ and $B$ .

We take inspiration from Li et al. (2018a); Aghajanyan et al. (2020) which show that the learned over-parametrized models in fact reside on a low intrinsic dimension. We hypothesize that the change in weights during model adaptation also has a low “intrinsic rank”, leading to our proposed Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach. LoRA allows us to train some dense layers in a neural network indirectly by optimizing rank decomposition matrices of the dense layers’ change during adaptation instead, while keeping the pre-trained weights frozen, as shown in Figure 1. Using GPT-3 175B as an example, we show that a very low rank (i.e., $r$ in Figure 1 can be one or two) suffices even when the full rank (i.e., $d$ ) is as high as 12,288, making LoRA both storage- and compute-efficient.

LoRA possesses several key advantages.

• A pre-trained model can be shared and used to build many small LoRA modules for different tasks. We can freeze the shared model and efficiently switch tasks by replacing the matrices $A$ and $B$ in Figure 1, reducing the storage requirement and task-switching overhead significantly.   
• LoRA makes training more efficient and lowers the hardware barrier to entry by up to 3 times when using adaptive optimizers since we do not need to calculate the gradients or maintain the optimizer states for most parameters. Instead, we only optimize the injected, much smaller low-rank matrices.   
• Our simple linear design allows us to merge the trainable matrices with the frozen weights when deployed, introducing no inference latency compared to a fully fine-tuned model, by construction.   
• LoRA is orthogonal to many prior methods and can be combined with many of them, such as prefix-tuning. We provide an example in Appendix E.

Terminologies and Conventions We make frequent references to the Transformer architecture and use the conventional terminologies for its dimensions. We call the input and output dimension size of a Transformer layer $d _ { m o d e l }$ . We use $W _ { q }$ , $W _ { k }$ , $W _ { v }$ , and $W _ { o }$ to refer to the query/key/value/output projection matrices in the self-attention module. $W$ or $W _ { 0 }$ refers to a pretrained weight matrix and $\Delta W$ its accumulated gradient update during adaptation. We use $r$ to denote the rank of a LoRA module. We follow the conventions set out by (Vaswani et al., 2017; Brown et al., 2020) and use Adam (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019; Kingma & Ba, 2017) for model optimization and use a Transformer MLP feedforward dimension $d _ { f f n } = 4 \times d _ { m o d e l }$ .

# 2 PROBLEM STATEMENT

While our proposal is agnostic to training objective, we focus on language modeling as our motivating use case. Below is a brief description of the language modeling problem and, in particular, the maximization of conditional probabilities given a task-specific prompt.

Suppose we are given a pre-trained autoregressive language model $P _ { \Phi } ( y | x )$ parametrized by $\Phi$ . For instance, $P _ { \Phi } ( y | x )$ can be a generic multi-task learner such as GPT (Radford et al., b; Brown et al., 2020) based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). Consider adapting this pre-trained model to downstream conditional text generation tasks, such as summarization, machine reading comprehension (MRC), and natural language to SQL (NL2SQL). Each downstream task is represented by a training dataset of context-target pairs: $\mathcal { Z } = \{ ( x _ { i } , y _ { i } ) \} _ { i = 1 , \dots , N }$ , where both $x _ { i }$ and $y _ { i }$ are sequences of tokens. For example, in NL2SQL, $x _ { i }$ is a natural language query and $y _ { i }$ its corresponding SQL command; for summarization, $x _ { i }$ is the content of an article and $y _ { i }$ its summary.

During full fine-tuning, the model is initialized to pre-trained weights $\Phi _ { 0 }$ and updated to $\Phi _ { 0 } + \Delta \Phi$ by repeatedly following the gradient to maximize the conditional language modeling objective:

$$
\operatorname* { m a x } _ { \Phi } \sum _ { ( x , y ) \in \mathcal { Z } } \sum _ { t = 1 } ^ { | y | } \log \left( P _ { \Phi } ( y _ { t } | x , y _ { < t } ) \right)
$$

One of the main drawbacks for full fine-tuning is that for each downstream task, we learn a different set of parameters $\Delta \Phi$ whose dimension $| \Delta \Phi |$ equals $| \Phi _ { 0 } |$ . Thus, if the pre-trained model is large (such as GPT-3 with $| \Phi _ { 0 } | \approx 1 7 5$ Billion), storing and deploying many independent instances of fine-tuned models can be challenging, if at all feasible.

In this paper, we adopt a more parameter-efficient approach, where the task-specific parameter increment $\Delta \Phi = \Delta \Phi ( \Theta )$ is further encoded by a much smaller-sized set of parameters $\Theta$ with $| \Theta | \ll | \Phi _ { 0 } |$ . The task of finding $\Delta \Phi$ thus becomes optimizing over $\Theta$ :

$$
\operatorname* { m a x } _ { \Theta } \sum _ { ( x , y ) \in \mathcal { Z } } \sum _ { t = 1 } ^ { | y | } \log \left( p _ { \Phi _ { 0 } + \Delta \Phi ( \Theta ) } ( y _ { t } | x , y _ { < t } ) \right)
$$

In the subsequent sections, we propose to use a low-rank representation to encode $\Delta \Phi$ that is both compute- and memory-efficient. When the pre-trained model is GPT-3 175B, the number of trainable parameters $| \Theta |$ can be as small as $0 . 0 1 \%$ of $| \Phi _ { 0 } |$ .

# 3 AREN’T EXISTING SOLUTIONS GOOD ENOUGH?

The problem we set out to tackle is by no means new. Since the inception of transfer learning, dozens of works have sought to make model adaptation more parameter- and compute-efficient. See Section 6 for a survey of some of the well-known works. Using language modeling as an example, there are two prominent strategies when it comes to efficient adaptations: adding adapter layers (Houlsby et al., 2019; Rebuffi et al., 2017; Pfeiffer et al., 2021; Ruckl ¨ e et al., 2020) or optimizing some forms ´ of the input layer activations (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021). However, both strategies have their limitations, especially in a large-scale and latency-sensitive production scenario.

Adapter Layers Introduce Inference Latency There are many variants of adapters. We focus on the original design by Houlsby et al. (2019) which has two adapter layers per Transformer block and a more recent one by Lin et al. (2020) which has only one per block but with an additional LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016). While one can reduce the overall latency by pruning layers or exploiting multi-task settings (Ruckl ¨ e et al., 2020; Pfeiffer et al., 2021), there is no direct ways to bypass ´ the extra compute in adapter layers. This seems like a non-issue since adapter layers are designed to have few parameters (sometimes ${ < } 1 \%$ of the original model) by having a small bottleneck dimension, which limits the FLOPs they can add. However, large neural networks rely on hardware parallelism to keep the latency low, and adapter layers have to be processed sequentially. This makes a difference in the online inference setting where the batch size is typically as small as one. In a generic scenario without model parallelism, such as running inference on GPT-2 (Radford et al., b) medium on a single GPU, we see a noticeable increase in latency when using adapters, even with a very small bottleneck dimension (Table 1).

This problem gets worse when we need to shard the model as done in Shoeybi et al. (2020); Lepikhin et al. (2020), because the additional depth requires more synchronous GPU operations such as AllReduce and Broadcast, unless we store the adapter parameters redundantly many times.

Directly Optimizing the Prompt is Hard The other direction, as exemplified by prefix tuning (Li & Liang, 2021), faces a different challenge. We observe that prefix tuning is difficult to optimize and that its performance changes non-monotonically in trainable parameters, confirming similar observations in the original paper. More fundamentally, reserving a part of the sequence length for adaptation necessarily reduces the sequence length available to process a downstream task, which we suspect makes tuning the prompt less performant compared to other methods. We defer the study on task performance to Section 5.

We use an NVIDIA Quadro RTX8000. “ $\left| \Theta \right|$ ” denotes the number of trainable parameters in adapter layers. AdapterL and AdapterH are two variants of adapter tuning, which we describe in Section 5.1. The inference latency introduced by adapter layers can be significant in an online, short-sequence-length scenario. See the full study in Appendix B.

# 4 OUR METHOD

We describe the simple design of LoRA and its practical benefits. The principles outlined here apply to any dense layers in deep learning models, though we only focus on certain weights in Transformer language models in our experiments as the motivating use case.

# 4.1 LOW-RANK-PARAMETRIZED UPDATE MATRICES

A neural network contains many dense layers which perform matrix multiplication. The weight matrices in these layers typically have full-rank. When adapting to a specific task, Aghajanyan et al. (2020) shows that the pre-trained language models have a low “instrisic dimension” and can still learn efficiently despite a random projection to a smaller subspace. Inspired by this, we hypothesize the updates to the weights also have a low “intrinsic rank” during adaptation. For a pre-trained weight matrix $W _ { 0 } \in \mathbb { R } ^ { d \times \mathcal { K } }$ , we constrain its update by representing the latter with a low-rank decomposition $W _ { 0 } + \Delta W = W _ { 0 } + B A$ , where $\bar { \boldsymbol { B } } \in \mathbb { R } ^ { \bar { d } \times r } , \dot { \boldsymbol { A } } \in \mathbb { R } ^ { r \times \overline { { \boldsymbol { k } } } }$ , and the rank $r \ll \operatorname* { m i n } ( d , k )$ . During training, $W _ { 0 }$ is frozen and does not receive gradient updates, while $A$ and $B$ contain trainable parameters. Note both $W _ { 0 }$ and $\Delta W = B A$ are multiplied with the same input, and their respective output vectors are summed coordinate-wise. For $h = W _ { 0 } x$ , our modified forward pass yields:

$$
h = W _ { 0 } x + \Delta W x = W _ { 0 } x + B A x
$$

We illustrate our reparametrization in Figure 1. We use a random Gaussian initialization for $A$ and zero for $B$ , so $\Delta W = B A$ is zero at the beginning of training. We then scale $\Delta W x$ by $\frac { \alpha } { r }$ , where $\alpha$ is a constant in $r$ . When optimizing with Adam, tuning $\alpha$ is roughly the same as tuning the learning rate if we scale the initialization appropriately. As a result, we simply set $\alpha$ to the first $r$ we try and do not tune it. This scaling helps to reduce the need to retune hyperparameters when we vary $r$ (Yang & Hu, 2021).

A Generalization of Full Fine-tuning. A more general form of fine-tuning allows the training of a subset of the pre-trained parameters. LoRA takes a step further and does not require the accumulated gradient update to weight matrices to have full-rank during adaptation. This means that when applying LoRA to all weight matrices and training all biases2, we roughly recover the expressiveness of full fine-tuning by setting the LoRA rank $r$ to the rank of the pre-trained weight matrices. In other words, as we increase the number of trainable parameters 3, training LoRA roughly converges to training the original model, while adapter-based methods converges to an MLP and prefix-based methods to a model that cannot take long input sequences.

No Additional Inference Latency. When deployed in production, we can explicitly compute and store $W = W _ { 0 } + B A$ and perform inference as usual. Note that both $W _ { 0 }$ and $B A$ are in $\mathbb { R } ^ { d \times k }$ . When we need to switch to another downstream task, we can recover $W _ { 0 }$ by subtracting $B A$ and then adding a different $B ^ { \prime } A ^ { \prime }$ , a quick operation with very little memory overhead. Critically, this guarantees that we do not introduce any additional latency during inference compared to a fine-tuned model by construction.

# 4.2 APPLYING LORA TO TRANSFORMER

In principle, we can apply LoRA to any subset of weight matrices in a neural network to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In the Transformer architecture, there are four weight matrices in the self-attention module $( W _ { q } , W _ { k } , W _ { v } , W _ { o } )$ and two in the MLP module. We treat $W _ { q }$ (or $W _ { k }$ , $W _ { v . }$ ) as a single matrix of dimension $d _ { m o d e l } \times d _ { m o d e l }$ , even though the output dimension is usually sliced into attention heads. We limit our study to only adapting the attention weights for downstream tasks and freeze the MLP modules (so they are not trained in downstream tasks) both for simplicity and parameter-efficiency.We further study the effect on adapting different types of attention weight matrices in a Transformer in Section 7.1. We leave the empirical investigation of adapting the MLP layers, LayerNorm layers, and biases to a future work.

Practical Benefits and Limitations. The most significant benefit comes from the reduction in memory and storage usage. For a large Transformer trained with Adam, we reduce that VRAM usage by up to $2 / 3$ if $r \ll d _ { m o d e l }$ as we do not need to store the optimizer states for the frozen parameters. On GPT-3 175B, we reduce the VRAM consumption during training from $1 . 2 \mathrm { T B }$ to 350GB. With $r = 4$ and only the query and value projection matrices being adapted, the checkpoint size is reduced by roughly $1 0 { , } 0 0 0 \times$ (from 350GB to 35MB)4. This allows us to train with significantly fewer GPUs and avoid I/O bottlenecks. Another benefit is that we can switch between tasks while deployed at a much lower cost by only swapping the LoRA weights as opposed to all the parameters. This allows for the creation of many customized models that can be swapped in and out on the fly on machines that store the pre-trained weights in VRAM. We also observe a $2 5 \%$ speedup during training on GPT-3 175B compared to full fine-tuning5 as we do not need to calculate the gradient for the vast majority of the parameters.

LoRA also has its limitations. For example, it is not straightforward to batch inputs to different tasks with different $A$ and $B$ in a single forward pass, if one chooses to absorb $A$ and $B$ into $W$ to eliminate additional inference latency. Though it is possible to not merge the weights and dynamically choose the LoRA modules to use for samples in a batch for scenarios where latency is not critical.

# 5 EMPIRICAL EXPERIMENTS

We evaluate the downstream task performance of LoRA on RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), DeBERTa (He et al., 2021), and GPT-2 (Radford et al., b), before scaling up to GPT-3 175B (Brown et al., 2020). Our experiments cover a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding (NLU) to generation (NLG). Specifically, we evaluate on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2019) benchmark for RoBERTa and DeBERTa. We follow the setup of Li & Liang (2021) on GPT-2 for a direct comparison and add WikiSQL (Zhong et al., 2017) (NL to SQL queries) and SAMSum (Gliwa et al., 2019) (conversation summarization) for large-scale experiments on GPT-3. See Appendix C for more details on the datasets we use. We use NVIDIA Tesla V100 for all experiments.

# 5.1 BASELINES

To compare with other baselines broadly, we replicate the setups used by prior work and reuse their reported numbers whenever possible. This, however, means that some baselines might only appear in certain experiments.

Fine-Tuning (FT) is a common approach for adaptation. During fine-tuning, the model is initialized to the pre-trained weights and biases, and all model parameters undergo gradient updates.A simple variant is to update only some layers while freezing others. We include one such baseline reported in prior work (Li & Liang, 2021) on GPT-2, which adapts just the last two layers $\mathbf { ( F T ^ { I o p 2 } ) }$ ).

Bias-only or BitFit is a baseline where we only train the bias vectors while freezing everything else.   
Contemporarily, this baseline has also been studied by BitFit (Zaken et al., 2021).

Prefix-embedding tuning (PreEmbed) inserts special tokens among the input tokens. These special tokens have trainable word embeddings and are generally not in the model’s vocabulary. Where to place such tokens can have an impact on performance. We focus on “prefixing”, which prepends such tokens to the prompt, and “infixing”, which appends to the prompt; both are discussed in Li & Liang (2021). We use $l _ { p }$ (resp. $l _ { i }$ ) denote the number of prefix (resp. infix) tokens. The number of trainable parameters is $| \Theta | = d _ { m o d e l } \times \left( l _ { p } + l _ { i } \right)$ .

Prefix-layer tuning (PreLayer) is an extension to prefix-embedding tuning. Instead of just learning the word embeddings (or equivalently, the activations after the embedding layer) for some special tokens, we learn the activations after every Transformer layer. The activations computed from previous layers are simply replaced by trainable ones. The resulting number of trainable parameters is $| \Theta | = L \times d _ { m o d e l } \times \left( l _ { p } + l _ { i } \right)$ , where $L$ is the number of Transformer layers.

Adapter tuning as proposed in Houlsby et al. (2019) inserts adapter layers between the selfattention module (and the MLP module) and the subsequent residual connection. There are two fully connected layers with biases in an adapter layer with a nonlinearity in between. We call this original design AdapterH. Recently, Lin et al. (2020) proposed a more efficient design with the adapter layer applied only after the MLP module and after a LayerNorm. We call it AdapterL. This is very similar to another deign proposed in Pfeiffer et al. (2021), which we call AdapterP. We also include another baseline call AdapterDrop (Ruckl ¨ e et al., 2020) which drops some adapter layers for ´ greater efficiency (AdapterD). We cite numbers from prior works whenever possible to maximize the number of baselines we compare with; they are in rows with an asterisk $( ^ { * } )$ in the first column. In all cases, we have $| \Theta | = \hat { L } _ { A d p t } \times \left( 2 \times d _ { m o d e l } \times r + r + d _ { m o d e l } \right) + 2 \times \hat { L } _ { L N } \times d _ { m o d e l }$ where $\hat { L } _ { A d p t }$ is the number of adapter layers and $\hat { L } _ { L N }$ the number of trainable LayerNorms (e.g., in AdapterL).

LoRA adds trainable pairs of rank decomposition matrices in parallel to existing weight matrices. As mentioned in Section 4.2, we only apply LoRA to $W _ { q }$ and $W _ { v }$ in most experiments for simplicity. The number of trainable parameters is determined by the rank $r$ and the shape of the original weights: $| \Theta | = 2 \times \hat { L } _ { L o R A } \times d _ { m o d e l } \times r$ , where $\hat { L } _ { L o R A }$ is the number of weight matrices we apply LoRA to.

# 5.2 ROBERTA BASE/LARGE

RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) optimized the pre-training recipe originally proposed in BERT (Devlin et al., 2019a) and boosted the latter’s task performance without introducing many more trainable parameters. While RoBERTa has been overtaken by much larger models on NLP leaderboards such as the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019) in recent years, it remains a competitive and popular pre-trained model for its size among practitioners. We take the pre-trained RoBERTa base (125M) and RoBERTa large (355M) from the HuggingFace Transformers library (Wolf et al., 2020) and evaluate the performance of different efficient adaptation approaches on tasks from the GLUE benchmark. We also replicate Houlsby et al. (2019) and Pfeiffer et al. (2021) according to their setup. To ensure a fair comparison, we make two crucial changes to how we evaluate LoRA when comparing with adapters. First, we use the same batch size for all tasks and use a sequence length of 128 to match the adapter baselines. Second, we initialize the model to the pre-trained model for MRPC, RTE, and STS-B, not a model already adapted to MNLI like the fine-tuning baseline. Runs following this more restricted setup from Houlsby et al. (2019) are labeled with $\dagger$ . The result is presented in Table 2 (Top Three Sections). See Section D.1 for details on the hyperparameters used.

# 5.3 DEBERTA XXL

DeBERTa (He et al., 2021) is a more recent variant of BERT that is trained on a much larger scale and performs very competitively on benchmarks such as GLUE (Wang et al., 2019) and SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2020). We evaluate if LoRA can still match the performance of a fully fine-tuned DeBERTa XXL (1.5B) on GLUE. The result is presented in Table 2 (Bottom Section). See Section D.2 for details on the hyperparameters used.

# 5.4 GPT-2 MEDIUM/LARGE

Having shown that LoRA can be a competitive alternative to full fine-tuning on NLU, we hope to answer if LoRA still prevails on NLG models, such as GPT-2 medium and large (Radford et al., b). We keep our setup as close as possible to Li & Liang (2021) for a direct comparison. Due to space constraint, we only present our result on E2E NLG Challenge (Table 3) in this section. See Section F.1 for results on WebNLG (Gardent et al., 2017) and DART (Nan et al., 2020). We include a list of the hyperparameters used in Section D.3.

Table 4: Performance of different adaptation methods on GPT-3 175B. We report the logical form validation accuracy on WikiSQL, validation accuracy on MultiNLI-matched, and Rouge-1/2/L on SAMSum. LoRA performs better than prior approaches, including full fine-tuning. The results on WikiSQL have a fluctuation around $\pm 0 . 5 \%$ , MNLI-m around $\pm 0 . 1 \%$ , and SAMSum around $\pm 0 . 2 / \pm 0 . 2 / \pm 0 . 1$ for the three metrics.

# 5.5 SCALING UP TO GPT-3 175B

As a final stress test for LoRA, we scale up to GPT-3 with 175 billion parameters. Due to the high training cost, we only report the typical standard deviation for a given task over random seeds, as opposed to providing one for every entry. See Section D.4 for details on the hyperparameters used.

As shown in Table 4, LoRA matches or exceeds the fine-tuning baseline on all three datasets. Note that not all methods benefit monotonically from having more trainable parameters, as shown in Figure 2. We observe a significant performance drop when we use more than 256 special tokens for prefix-embedding tuning or more than 32 special tokens for prefix-layer tuning. This corroborates similar observations in Li & Liang (2021). While a thorough investigation into this phenomenon is out-of-scope for this work, we suspect that having more special tokens causes the input distribution to shift further away from the pre-training data distribution. Separately, we investigate the performance of different adaptation approaches in the low-data regime in Section F.3.

![## Image Analysis: b78fc4eee7f430e85d9521567b0630bdfad01922a8315f07c70a9a909adf37ac.jpg

**Conceptual Understanding:**
This image visually represents a comparative analysis of different adaptation methods for large language models, specifically in the context of scaling up to models like GPT-3 175B. Conceptually, it illustrates the relationship between the computational cost (number of trainable parameters) and the performance (validation accuracy) of these methods on specific natural language processing tasks. The main purpose is to demonstrate which adaptation methods are most efficient and effective for fine-tuning large pre-trained models, particularly highlighting methods that achieve high accuracy with a relatively low number of additional trainable parameters, thereby improving scalability and reducing computational overhead. It helps researchers and practitioners choose optimal methods for adapting massive models to downstream tasks.

**Content Interpretation:**
The image illustrates the performance of various model adaptation methods, namely Fine-Tune, PrefixEmbed, PrefixLayer, Adapter(H), and LoRA, in terms of validation accuracy as the number of trainable parameters changes. This directly demonstrates the scalability and efficiency of these methods when applied to large language models like GPT-3 175B. The graphs show that some methods are more parameter-efficient (achieve high accuracy with fewer trainable parameters) and/or scale better (maintain or improve accuracy as trainable parameters increase). The significance of the data lies in identifying which adaptation methods offer superior performance for tasks like WikiSQL (a semantic parsing dataset) and MultiNLI-matched (a natural language inference dataset) while requiring fewer trainable parameters, which is critical for scaling up to very large models. The comparison highlights trade-offs between parameter efficiency and peak performance across different methods and tasks.

**Key Insights:**
The main takeaway from this image is that LoRA and Adapter(H) generally achieve higher validation accuracy with fewer trainable parameters compared to PrefixEmbed and PrefixLayer, especially when scaling up. For instance, on both WikiSQL and MultiNLI-matched, 'LoRA' (purple inverted triangle) consistently reaches and maintains the highest validation accuracy across a broad range of trainable parameters. 'Adapter(H)' (brown 'x' symbol) also shows strong performance, often mirroring 'LoRA' at higher parameter counts. 'PrefixLayer' (green star) and 'PrefixEmbed' (orange plus) demonstrate more varied performance, often peaking and then declining, and generally not reaching the highest accuracy levels of 'LoRA' or 'Adapter(H)'. The single 'Fine-Tune' data point (blue dot) represents a very high number of trainable parameters (log₁₀ # Trainable Parameters at around 11) and yields a high validation accuracy, serving as a baseline for the other methods. This suggests that LoRA and Adapter(H) are more efficient adaptation methods for large models like GPT-3 175B, requiring fewer trainable parameters to achieve comparable or superior performance relative to other methods, and exhibiting better scalability.

**Document Context:**
This image is highly relevant to the document's section '5.5 SCALING UP TO GPT-3 175B' as it provides empirical evidence to support claims about the scalability and task performance of different adaptation methods, specifically highlighting LoRA's advantages. The preceding text mentions GPT-3 175B, and this figure directly shows how various methods perform when adapting such a large model. The text after the image explicitly states, 'LoRA exhibits better scalability and task performance,' which is visually supported by the graphs. The graphs serve to validate the effectiveness of these methods in a practical, large-scale context, demonstrating which approaches are most efficient for achieving high validation accuracy with large models.

**Summary:**
The image displays two line graphs, side-by-side, comparing the validation accuracy of several adaptation methods against the number of trainable parameters on two different datasets: WikiSQL and MultiNLI-matched. Each graph plots Validation Accuracy on the Y-axis against log₁₀ # Trainable Parameters on the X-axis. The shared legend identifies five distinct methods: 'Fine-Tune' (blue dot), 'PrefixEmbed' (orange plus symbol), 'PrefixLayer' (green star), 'Adapter(H)' (brown 'x' symbol), and 'LoRA' (purple inverted triangle). On both graphs, 'LoRA' generally shows higher validation accuracy across a range of trainable parameters, particularly at the higher end, often maintaining a flatter, higher performance curve. 'Adapter(H)' also performs well, closely trailing or matching 'LoRA' at higher parameter counts. 'PrefixLayer' and 'PrefixEmbed' show more variability and tend to peak at lower parameter counts before decreasing in accuracy. The 'Fine-Tune' method is represented by a single data point on each graph, indicating a high number of trainable parameters (log₁₀ # Trainable Parameters around 11) with moderate to high validation accuracy.](images/b78fc4eee7f430e85d9521567b0630bdfad01922a8315f07c70a9a909adf37ac.jpg)

# 6 RELATED WORKS

Transformer Language Models. Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is a sequence-to-sequence architecture that makes heavy use of self-attention. Radford et al. (a) applied it to autoregressive language modeling by using a stack of Transformer decoders. Since then, Transformer-based language models have dominated NLP, achieving the state-of-the-art in many tasks. A new paradigm emerged with BERT (Devlin et al., 2019b) and GPT-2 (Radford et al., b) – both are large Transformer language models trained on a large amount of text – where fine-tuning on task-specific data after pretraining on general domain data provides a significant performance gain compared to training on task-specific data directly. Training larger Transformers generally results in better performance and remains an active research direction. GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) is the largest single Transformer language model trained to-date with 175B parameters.

Prompt Engineering and Fine-Tuning. While GPT-3 175B can adapt its behavior with just a few additional training examples, the result depends heavily on the input prompt (Brown et al., 2020). This necessitates an empirical art of composing and formatting the prompt to maximize a model’s performance on a desired task, which is known as prompt engineering or prompt hacking. Fine-tuning retrains a model pre-trained on general domains to a specific task Devlin et al. (2019b); Radford et al. (a). Variants of it include learning just a subset of the parameters Devlin et al. (2019b); Collobert & Weston (2008), yet practitioners often retrain all of them to maximize the downstream performance. However, the enormity of GPT-3 175B makes it challenging to perform fine-tuning in the usual way due to the large checkpoint it produces and the high hardware barrier to entry since it has the same memory footprint as pre-training.

Parameter-Efficient Adaptation. Many have proposed inserting adapter layers between existing layers in a neural network (Houlsby et al., 2019; Rebuffi et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2020). Our method uses a similar bottleneck structure to impose a low-rank constraint on the weight updates. The key functional difference is that our learned weights can be merged with the main weights during inference, thus not introducing any latency, which is not the case for the adapter layers (Section 3). A comtenporary extension of adapter is COMPACTER (Mahabadi et al., 2021), which essentially parametrizes the adapter layers using Kronecker products with some predetermined weight sharing scheme. Similarly, combining LoRA with other tensor product-based methods could potentially improve its parameter efficiency, which we leave to future work. More recently, many proposed optimizing the input word embeddings in lieu of fine-tuning, akin to a continuous and differentiable generalization of prompt engineering (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021). We include comparisons with Li & Liang (2021) in our experiment section. However, this line of works can only scale up by using more special tokens in the prompt, which take up available sequence length for task tokens when positional embeddings are learned.

Low-Rank Structures in Deep Learning. Low-rank structure is very common in machine learning. A lot of machine learning problems have certain intrinsic low-rank structure (Li et al., 2016; Cai et al., 2010; Li et al., 2018b; Grasedyck et al., 2013). Moreover, it is known that for many deep learning tasks, especially those with a heavily over-parametrized neural network, the learned neural network will enjoy low-rank properties after training (Oymak et al., 2019). Some prior works even explicitly impose the low-rank constraint when training the original neural network (Sainath et al., 2013; Povey et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2014; Jaderberg et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2016; Khodak et al., 2021; Denil et al., 2014); however, to the best of our knowledge, none of these works considers low-rank update to a frozen model for adaptation to downstream tasks. In theory literature, it is known that neural networks outperform other classical learning methods, including the corresponding (finite-width) neural tangent kernels (Allen-Zhu et al., 2019; Li & Liang, 2018) when the underlying concept class has certain low-rank structure (Ghorbani et al., 2020; Allen-Zhu & Li, 2019; Allen-Zhu & Li, 2020a). Another theoretical result in Allen-Zhu & Li (2020b) suggests that low-rank adaptations can be useful for adversarial training. In sum, we believe that our proposed low-rank adaptation update is well-motivated by the literature.

# 7 UNDERSTANDING THE LOW-RANK UPDATES

Given the empirical advantage of LoRA, we hope to further explain the properties of the low-rank adaptation learned from downstream tasks. Note that the low-rank structure not only lowers the hardware barrier to entry which allows us to run multiple experiments in parallel, but also gives better interpretability of how the update weights are correlated with the pre-trained weights. We focus our study on GPT-3 175B, where we achieved the largest reduction of trainable parameters (up to $1 0 { , } 0 0 0 \times )$ without adversely affecting task performances.

We perform a sequence of empirical studies to answer the following questions: 1) Given a parameter budget constraint, which subset of weight matrices in a pre-trained Transformer should we adapt to maximize downstream performance? 2) Is the “optimal” adaptation matrix $\Delta W$ really rankdeficient? If so, what is a good rank to use in practice? 3) What is the connection between $\Delta W$ and W ? Does $\Delta W$ highly correlate with W ? How large is $\Delta W$ comparing to W ?

We believe that our answers to question (2) and (3) shed light on the fundamental principles of using pre-trained language models for downstream tasks, which is a critical topic in NLP.

# 7.1 WHICH WEIGHT MATRICES IN TRANSFORMER SHOULD WE APPLY LORA TO?

Given a limited parameter budget, which types of weights should we adapt with LoRA to obtain the best performance on downstream tasks? As mentioned in Section 4.2, we only consider weight matrices in the self-attention module. We set a parameter budget of 18M (roughly 35MB if stored in FP16) on GPT-3 175B, which corresponds to $r = 8$ if we adapt one type of attention weights or $r = 4$ if we adapt two types, for all 96 layers. The result is presented in Table 5.

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="7"># of Trainable Parameters = 18M</td></tr><tr><td>Weight Type Rank r</td><td>Wq 8</td><td>Wk 8</td><td>Wu 8</td><td>W。 8</td><td>Wq,Wk 4</td><td>Wq,Wu 4</td><td>Wq, Wk,Wo,Wo 2</td></tr><tr><td>WikiSQL (±0.5%)</td><td>70.4</td><td>70.0</td><td>73.0</td><td>73.2</td><td>71.4</td><td>73.7</td><td>73.7</td></tr><tr><td>MultiNLI(±0.1%)</td><td>91.0</td><td>90.8</td><td>91.0</td><td>91.3</td><td>91.3</td><td>91.3</td><td>91.7</td></tr></table>

Table 5: Validation accuracy on WikiSQL and MultiNLI after applying LoRA to different types of attention weights in GPT-3, given the same number of trainable parameters. Adapting both $W _ { q }$ and $W _ { v }$ gives the best performance overall. We find the standard deviation across random seeds to be consistent for a given dataset, which we report in the first column.

Note that putting all the parameters in $\Delta W _ { q }$ or $\Delta W _ { k }$ results in significantly lower performance, while adapting both $W _ { q }$ and $W _ { v }$ yields the best result. This suggests that even a rank of four captures enough information in $\Delta W$ such that it is preferable to adapt more weight matrices than adapting a single type of weights with a larger rank.

# 7.2 WHAT IS THE OPTIMAL RANK $r$ FOR LORA?

We turn our attention to the effect of rank $r$ on model performance. We adapt $\{ W _ { q } , W _ { v } \}$ , $\{ W _ { q } , W _ { k } , W _ { v } , W _ { c } \}$ , and just $W _ { q }$ for a comparison.

Table 6: Validation accuracy on WikiSQL and MultiNLI with different rank $r$ . To our surprise, a rank as small as one suffices for adapting both $W _ { q }$ and $W _ { v }$ on these datasets while training $W _ { q }$ alone needs a larger $r$ . We conduct a similar experiment on GPT-2 in Section H.2.

Table 6 shows that, surprisingly, LoRA already performs competitively with a very small $r$ (more so for $\{ W _ { q } , W _ { v } \}$ than just $W _ { q , }$ ). This suggests the update matrix $\Delta W$ could have a very small “intrinsic rank”.6 To further support this finding, we check the overlap of the subspaces learned by different choices of $r$ and by different random seeds. We argue that increasing $r$ does not cover a more meaningful subspace, which suggests that a low-rank adaptation matrix is sufficient.

Subspace similarity between different $\mathbfit { \Delta } \mathbf { r }$ . Given $A _ { r = 8 }$ and $A _ { r = 6 4 }$ which are the learned adaptation matrices with rank $r = 8$ and 64 using the same pre-trained model, we perform singular value decomposition and obtain the right-singular unitary matrices $U _ { A _ { r = 8 } }$ and $U _ { A _ { r = 6 4 } }$ .7 We hope to answer: how much of the subspace spanned by the top $i$ singular vectors in $U _ { A _ { r = 8 } }$ (for $1 \leq i \leq 8$ ) is contained in the subspace spanned by top $j$ singular vectors of $U _ { A _ { r = 6 4 } }$ (for $1 \leq j \leq 6 4 )$ ? We measure this quantity with a normalized subspace similarity based on the Grassmann distance (See Appendix $\mathbf { G }$ for a more formal discussion)

$$
\phi ( A _ { r = 8 } , A _ { r = 6 4 } , i , j ) = \frac { | | U _ { A _ { r = 8 } } ^ { i ^ { \top } } U _ { A _ { r = 6 4 } } ^ { j } | | _ { F } ^ { 2 } } { \operatorname* { m i n } ( i , j ) } \in [ 0 , 1 ]
$$

where $U _ { A _ { r = 8 } } ^ { i }$ represents the columns of $U _ { A _ { r = 8 } }$ corresponding to the top- $i$ singular vectors.

$\phi ( \cdot )$ has a range of $[ 0 , 1 ]$ , where 1 represents a complete overlap of subspaces and 0 a complete separation. See Figure 3 for how $\phi$ changes as we vary $i$ and $j$ . We only look at the 48th layer (out of 96) due to space constraint, but the conclusion holds for other layers as well, as shown in Section H.1.

**Conceptual Understanding:**
This image conceptually represents the relationship between the basis vectors (specifically, column vectors of $A$) of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weight matrices, $\Delta W_q$ and $\Delta W_v$, when using different ranks, $r=8$ and $r=64$. It visualizes the 'subspace similarity' between these vectors.

The main purpose of the image is to illustrate the degree to which the principal directions (or 'top directions') identified at a lower LoRA rank ($r=8$) are present and aligned within a higher LoRA rank ($r=64$) representation. By showing these similarities, it aims to provide evidence for understanding the redundancy or uniqueness of information captured as the rank of LoRA increases. The comparison helps to ascertain if increasing the rank introduces entirely new directions or primarily refines existing ones.

**Content Interpretation:**
The image presents four heatmaps illustrating the subspace similarity of column vectors from Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weight matrices, specifically $\Delta W_q$ (query weights) and $\Delta W_v$ (value weights), for different ranks ($r=8$ and $r=64$).

The first two heatmaps depict the similarity between column vectors of $A_{r=8}$ (vertical axis 'i' from 1 to 8) and column vectors of $A_{r=64}$ (horizontal axis 'j' showing selected indices 1, 6, 12, 18, 23, 29, 35, 40, 46, 52, 58). The highly similar (lighter colored) regions at specific 'j' indices for each 'i' suggest that each of the 8 principal directions of $A_{r=8}$ has a strong corresponding direction within the $A_{r=64}$ space.

The third and fourth heatmaps, which are described as zoomed-in views focusing on the lower-left triangle of the first two, show the similarity between the top 8 column vectors of $A_{r=64}$ (vertical axis 'i' from 1 to 8) and the 8 column vectors of $A_{r=8}$ (horizontal axis 'j' from 1 to 8). The prominent diagonal of high similarity in these plots indicates a direct, almost perfect, correspondence between the $i$-th principal direction of $A_{r=64}$ and the $i$-th principal direction of $A_{r=8}$ for the leading 8 components. This directly supports the idea that the 'top directions' are shared.

In essence, the figure shows how the essential directions captured by a lower rank (r=8) are largely retained and mirrored within a higher rank (r=64), implying a strong consistency in the most dominant features learned by LoRA.

**Key Insights:**
The main takeaway from this image is the strong preservation and alignment of the most significant principal directions (column vectors) across different LoRA ranks. The figure demonstrates that the top 8 directions (from $A_{r=8}$) are essentially included within the set of directions found at a higher rank ($A_{r=64}$), and vice versa, when considering the leading components.

Specific textual evidence supporting this includes:
- The labels "$\Delta W_q$" and "$\Delta W_v$" indicate the specific components of LoRA weights being analyzed.
- The axis labels 'i' (1-8) and 'j' (1, 6, 12, ..., 58 for the first pair, and 1-8 for the second pair) explicitly define the indices of the column vectors being compared, representing $A_{r=8}$ and $A_{r=64}$ as per the document context.
- The color bar ranging from "0.0" to "1.0" quantitatively measures the subspace similarity, with lighter colors indicating higher similarity. The prominent light pink/orange regions, particularly the diagonal in the 8x8 heatmaps, visually confirm high similarity (values close to 1.0).

The insight derived is that the core information represented by the top-ranked components of LoRA is robust and stable even when the overall rank is increased. This suggests that the 'optimal' rank might not need to be exceedingly high, as the most impactful features are already captured at lower ranks, with higher ranks potentially adding more nuanced or less critical information.

**Document Context:**
This image is critically relevant to Section 7.2, "WHAT IS THE OPTIMAL RANK $r$ FOR LORA?". It provides visual evidence to support the discussion around selecting an appropriate rank for LoRA. By demonstrating that the principal directions identified at a lower rank ($r=8$) are largely preserved and correspond to the leading directions at a higher rank ($r=64$), the image helps to explain why increasing the rank beyond a certain point might yield diminishing returns in terms of capturing fundamentally new information. This visual analysis directly contributes to understanding the trade-offs and implications of choosing different ranks for LoRA performance and efficiency, suggesting that the most impactful components are stable across different rank choices.

**Summary:**
The image displays four heatmaps, organized into two pairs. Each pair presents subspace similarity for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weight matrices, specifically for query weights ($\Delta W_q$) and value weights ($\Delta W_v$). A color bar on the right indicates the similarity scale from 0.0 (darkest purple) to 1.0 (lightest pink/orange). 

The first two heatmaps, labeled "$\Delta W_q$" and "$\Delta W_v$" from left to right, show the similarity between the 8 column vectors of $A_{r=8}$ (on the vertical 'i' axis, labeled 1 through 8) and a selection of 10 column vectors of $A_{r=64}$ (on the horizontal 'j' axis, labeled 1, 6, 12, 18, 23, 29, 35, 40, 46, 52, 58). In these plots, for each 'i' from 1 to 8, there's a distinct region of high similarity (lighter pink/orange color) corresponding to specific 'j' indices. This indicates that each of the 8 principal directions from $A_{r=8}$ is highly aligned with a particular direction within the larger $A_{r=64}$ set.

The last two heatmaps, also labeled "$\Delta W_q$" and "$\Delta W_v$", display the similarity between the top 8 column vectors of $A_{r=64}$ (on the vertical 'i' axis, labeled 1 through 8) and the 8 column vectors of $A_{r=8}$ (on the horizontal 'j' axis, labeled 1 through 8). These plots exhibit a clear diagonal band of very high similarity (lightest pink/orange), indicating a strong, almost one-to-one correspondence between the i-th vector of $A_{r=64}$ and the i-th vector of $A_{r=8}$ for the top 8 directions. The regions off the main diagonal show lower similarity (darker purple).

Overall, the figure visually demonstrates the strong alignment and inclusion of lower-rank principal components within higher-rank components for LoRA weight matrices, particularly highlighting that the top directions of $r=8$ are preserved within $r=64$, and vice versa, when comparing the leading components.](images/0efd763600d2224bb9af8016fa0689839257a3cf28c3b702d8eb226106367ac8.jpg)
Figure 3: Subspace similarity between column vectors of $A _ { r = 8 }$ and $A _ { r = 6 4 }$ for both $\Delta W _ { q }$ and $\Delta W _ { v }$ . The third and the fourth figures zoom in on the lower-left triangle in the first two figures. The top directions in $r = 8$ are included in $r = 6 4$ , and vice versa.

We make an important observation from Figure 3.

Directions corresponding to the top singular vector overlap significantly between $A _ { r = 8 }$ and $A _ { r = 6 4 }$ , while others do not. Specifically, $\Delta W _ { v }$ (resp. $\Delta W _ { q } )$ ) of $A _ { r = 8 }$ and $\Delta W _ { v }$ (resp. $\Delta W _ { q } ,$ ) of $A _ { r = 6 4 }$ share a subspace of dimension 1 with normalized similarity $> 0 . 5$ , providing an explanation of why $r = 1$ performs quite well in our downstream tasks for GPT-3.

Since both $A _ { r = 8 }$ and $A _ { r = 6 4 }$ are learned using the same pre-trained model, Figure 3 indicates that the top singular-vector directions of $A _ { r = 8 }$ and $A _ { r = 6 4 }$ are the most useful, while other directions potentially contain mostly random noises accumulated during training. Hence, the adaptation matrix can indeed have a very low rank.

Subspace similarity between different random seeds. We further confirm this by plotting the normalized subspace similarity between two randomly seeded runs with $r = 6 4$ , shown in Figure 4. $\Delta W _ { q }$ appears to have a higher “intrinsic rank” than $\Delta W _ { v }$ , since more common singular value directions are learned by both runs for $\Delta W _ { q }$ , which is in line with our empirical observation in Table 6. As a comparison, we also plot two random Gaussian matrices, which do not share any common singular value directions with each other.

# 7.3 HOW DOES THE ADAPTATION MATRIX ∆W COMPARE TO W ?

We further investigate the relationship between $\Delta W$ and $W$ . In particular, does $\Delta W$ highly correlate with W ? (Or mathematically, is $\Delta W$ mostly contained in the top singular directions of $W ?$ ) Also, how “large” is $\Delta W$ comparing to its corresponding directions in W ? This can shed light on the underlying mechanism for adapting pre-trained language models.

**Conceptual Understanding:**
This image conceptually represents the internal structure and relationships within adaptation matrices (∆Wq and ∆Wv) by visualizing the normalized subspace similarity between their column vectors. The main purpose is to demonstrate that these adaptation matrices possess specific, non-random patterns of similarity, particularly among their lower-indexed column vectors, which differentiates them from purely random matrices. It aims to provide insights into how these matrices are structured and whether their components (column vectors) exhibit inherent relationships or dependencies. The key idea being communicated is that the adaptation process results in a structured matrix, where early components (as indexed by 'i' and 'j') are more correlated, rather than a uniformly random or unstructured matrix.

**Content Interpretation:**
The image displays three heatmaps that visualize the normalized subspace similarity between column vectors. The left plot shows the similarity for the adaptation matrix ∆Wq, specifically between column vectors of Ar=64 from two random seeds. The middle plot shows the similarity for ∆Wv, also between column vectors of Ar=64 from two random seeds, as indicated by the title 'Φ(Ar=64, A'r=64, i, j)'. Both the ∆Wq and ∆Wv heatmaps exhibit a clear pattern: higher similarity values (indicated by orange/red colors) are concentrated in the top-left region where both 'i' and 'j' indices are low. As 'i' and 'j' increase, moving towards the bottom and right of the heatmap, the similarity values decrease, becoming dark purple/black. This suggests a strong correlation or structural similarity among the initial (lower-indexed) column vectors of the adaptation matrices. The right plot, labeled 'Random Gaussian', acts as a control and shows a uniformly low similarity (dark purple/black) across all 'i' and 'j' values, which is consistent with the expectation for random matrices. The contrast between the structured patterns in ∆Wq and ∆Wv and the uniform randomness of the 'Random Gaussian' plot is significant. The specific text 'Ar=64' and 'A'r=64' indicates that the analysis is performed on matrices with a rank of 64. The labels 'i' and 'j' denote the indices of the column vectors being compared, and the values on the color bar (0.0 to 0.5) represent the range of normalized subspace similarity.

**Key Insights:**
The main takeaway from this image is that the adaptation matrices ∆Wq and ∆Wv exhibit significant, non-random structural patterns in their column vectors. Specifically, there is a higher degree of normalized subspace similarity among the column vectors with lower indices ('i' and 'j'). This is evidenced by the bright red/orange 'L-shaped' regions in the top-left corners of the '∆Wq' and '∆Wv' heatmaps, where values approach 0.5. As the indices 'i' and 'j' increase, the similarity drops significantly, indicated by the darker purple/black regions. In stark contrast, the 'Random Gaussian' matrix shows almost no discernible similarity pattern, with uniformly low values across all indices. This provides strong evidence that the adaptation matrices are not random, but instead possess a structured organization where initial components are more similar to each other. This implies a hierarchical or ordered structure in how these matrices adapt or encode information, particularly in the lower-indexed dimensions. The consistent pattern across both ∆Wq and ∆Wv suggests a common underlying mechanism for adaptation in these different components.

**Document Context:**
This image is highly relevant to understanding the structural properties and differences of adaptation matrices (∆Wq and ∆Wv) within a larger document discussing 'HOW DOES THE ADAPTATION MATRIX ∆W COMPARE TO W?'. It provides visual evidence supporting claims about the internal structure and behavior of these matrices. The comparison with 'Random Gaussian' matrices serves as a critical baseline, demonstrating that the observed patterns in ∆Wq and ∆Wv are not merely random occurrences but rather reflect intrinsic properties. The accompanying text reference to '48-th layer' further contextualizes these results to specific layers within a neural network or model, and the reference to 'Section H.1 for other layers' implies that these findings are part of a broader analysis across different layers. The image directly addresses the document's section question by visually illustrating how ∆Wq and ∆Wv exhibit non-random, structured similarities among their column vectors, unlike purely random matrices.

**Summary:**
This image presents three heatmaps comparing the normalized subspace similarity of column vectors, specifically focusing on the adaptation matrices ∆Wq and ∆Wv, and a control case using random Gaussian matrices. The left heatmap, labeled '∆Wq', displays the subspace similarity for ∆Wq. The middle heatmap, labeled 'Φ(Ar=64, A'r=64, i, j)' and subtitled '∆Wv', shows the similarity for ∆Wv. The rightmost heatmap, titled 'Random Gaussian', serves as a baseline comparison. All heatmaps share a common structure: the y-axis is labeled 'i' and ranges from 1 to 56 with ticks at 1, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 56. The x-axis is labeled 'j' and ranges from 1 to 59 with ticks at 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 34, 39, 44, 49, 54, and 59. A color bar on the right side of the figure indicates the similarity values, ranging from 0.0 (dark purple/black) to 0.5 (bright orange/red). The '∆Wq' and '∆Wv' heatmaps both show high similarity (red/orange) along the top and left edges, forming an L-shape pattern that gradually fades to lower similarity (darker purple/black) towards the bottom-right corner. This indicates that column vectors with smaller 'i' and 'j' indices have higher similarity. The 'Random Gaussian' heatmap, in contrast, is uniformly dark purple/black, indicating very low or zero similarity across all 'i' and 'j' values. This clear distinction highlights that the patterns observed in ∆Wq and ∆Wv are not random.](images/f14ead9b73debdce3f328694cbab81ed21aa8558d486ae8e70f39e426856f6e9.jpg)
Figure 4: Left and Middle: Normalized subspace similarity between the column vectors of $A _ { r = 6 4 }$ from two random seeds, for both $\Delta W _ { q }$ and $\Delta W _ { v }$ in the 48-th layer. Right: the same heat-map between the column vectors of two random Gaussian matrices. See Section H.1 for other layers.

To answer these questions, we project $W$ onto the $r$ -dimensional subspace of $\Delta W$ by computing $U ^ { \top } W V ^ { \top }$ , with $U / V$ being the left/right singular-vector matrix of $\Delta W$ . Then, we compare the Frobenius norm between $\| U ^ { \top } W V ^ { \top } \| _ { F }$ and $\| W \| _ { F }$ . As a comparison, we also compute $ { \Vert }  { \boldsymbol { U } } ^ { \top }  { \boldsymbol { W } }  { \boldsymbol { V } } ^ { \top }  { \boldsymbol { \parallel } } _ { F }$ by replacing $U , V$ with the top $r$ singular vectors of $W$ or a random matrix.

$$
\frac { 1 }  \vert \vert U ^ { \top } W _ { q } V ^ { \top } \vert \vert _ { F } = \vert \begin{array} { c c c c c } { { \vert } } & { { r = 4 } } & { { r = 6 4 } } \\ { { \Delta W _ { q } } } & { { W _ { q } } } & { { \mathrm { R a n d o m } \ \middle \vert } } & { { \Delta W _ { q } } } & { { W _ { q } \quad \mathrm { R a n d o m } } } \end{array}
$$

Table 7: The Frobenius norm of $U ^ { \top } W _ { q } V ^ { \top }$ where $U$ and $V$ are the left/right top $r$ singular vector directions of either (1) $\Delta W _ { q }$ , (2) $W _ { q }$ , or (3) a random matrix. The weight matrices are taken from the $4 8 \mathrm { t h }$ layer of GPT-3.

We draw several conclusions from Table 7. First, $\Delta W$ has a stronger correlation with $W$ compared to a random matrix, indicating that $\Delta W$ amplifies some features that are already in $W$ . Second, instead of repeating the top singular directions of $W$ , $\Delta W$ only amplifies directions that are not emphasized in $W$ . Third, the amplification factor is rather huge: $2 \bar { 1 } . \bar { 5 } \approx 6 . 9 1 / 0 . 3 2$ for $r = 4$ . See Section H.4 for why $r = 6 4$ has a smaller amplification factor. We also provide a visualization in Section H.3 for how the correlation changes as we include more top singular directions from $W _ { q }$ . This suggests that the low-rank adaptation matrix potentially amplifies the important features for specific downstream tasks that were learned but not emphasized in the general pre-training model.

# 8 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

Fine-tuning enormous language models is prohibitively expensive in terms of the hardware required and the storage/switching cost for hosting independent instances for different tasks. We propose LoRA, an efficient adaptation strategy that neither introduces inference latency nor reduces input sequence length while retaining high model quality. Importantly, it allows for quick task-switching when deployed as a service by sharing the vast majority of the model parameters. While we focused on Transformer language models, the proposed principles are generally applicable to any neural networks with dense layers.

There are many directions for future works. 1) LoRA can be combined with other efficient adaptation methods, potentially providing orthogonal improvement. 2) The mechanism behind fine-tuning or LoRA is far from clear – how are features learned during pre-training transformed to do well on downstream tasks? We believe that LoRA makes it more tractable to answer this than full finetuning. 3) We mostly depend on heuristics to select the weight matrices to apply LoRA to. Are there more principled ways to do it? 4) Finally, the rank-deficiency of $\Delta W$ suggests that $W$ could be rank-deficient as well, which can also be a source of inspiration for future works.

# A LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS STILL NEED PARAMETER UPDATES

Few-shot learning, or prompt engineering, is very advantageous when we only have a handful of training samples. However, in practice, we can often afford to curate a few thousand or more training examples for performance-sensitive applications. As shown in Table 8, fine-tuning improves the model performance drastically compared to few-shot learning on datasets large and small. We take the GPT-3 few-shot result on RTE from the GPT-3 paper (Brown et al., 2020). For MNLI-matched, we use two demonstrations per class and six in-context examples in total.

<table><tr><td>Method</td><td>MNLI-m (Val. Acc./%)</td><td>RTE (Val. Acc./%)</td></tr><tr><td>GPT-3 Few-Shot</td><td>40.6</td><td>69.0</td></tr><tr><td>GPT-3 Fine-Tuned</td><td>89.5</td><td>85.4</td></tr></table>

# B INFERENCE LATENCY INTRODUCED BY ADAPTER LAYERS

Adapter layers are external modules added to a pre-trained model in a sequential manner, whereas our proposal, LoRA, can be seen as external modules added in a parallel manner. Consequently, adapter layers must be computed in addition to the base model, inevitably introducing additional latency. While as pointed out in Ruckl ¨ e et al. (2020), the latency introduced by adapter layers can ´ be mitigated when the model batch size and/or sequence length is large enough to full utilize the hardware parallelism. We confirm their observation with a similar latency study on GPT-2 medium and point out that there are scenarios, notably online inference where the batch size is small, where the added latency can be significant.

We measure the latency of a single forward pass on an NVIDIA Quadro RTX8000 by averaging over 100 trials. We vary the input batch size, sequence length, and the adapter bottleneck dimension $r$ . We test two adapter designs: the original one by Houlsby et al. (2019), which we call AdapterH, and a recent, more efficient variant by Lin et al. (2020), which we call AdapterL. See Section 5.1 for more details on the designs. We plot the slow-down in percentage compared to the no-adapter baseline in Figure 5.

![## Image Analysis: 3b249ac047bb910cc375d09c73389ecbc44d89039de67d2a0a247f227cdc217a.jpg

**Conceptual Understanding:**
This image conceptually represents a performance analysis of neural network models incorporating 'adapter layers,' specifically focusing on the 'inference latency' overhead introduced by these adapters. It aims to quantify how different operational parameters—namely, 'sequence length' of the input data, the 'rank' of the adapter layer, and the 'batch size' used during inference—influence the processing speed.

The main purpose of the image is to visually demonstrate the trade-offs associated with using adapter layers. It highlights the conditions under which these layers might significantly slow down model inference, and conversely, the conditions under which their impact on latency is minimal. By presenting data for two different adapter types, 'AdapterH' and 'AdapterL', the image also allows for a comparative understanding of their respective performance characteristics.

The key ideas being communicated are:
1.  **Latency Overhead:** Adapter layers, while offering benefits (likely efficiency in training or transfer learning, though not explicitly stated in the image), introduce an overhead in inference latency.
2.  **Parameter Sensitivity:** This latency overhead is not constant but is highly sensitive to input 'sequence length', 'batch size', and the adapter's 'rank' ('r').
3.  **Mitigation Strategies:** Larger 'batch sizes' and longer 'sequence lengths' generally help to mitigate this latency, making the model inference faster relative to the no-adapter baseline.
4.  **Worst-Case Scenarios:** Short sequence lengths combined with small batch sizes represent a 'worst-case' scenario where latency can be substantial (over 30% slowdown).
5.  **Adapter Type Comparison:** While showing similar trends, the subtle differences between 'AdapterH' and 'AdapterL' under various conditions can be observed, aiding in informed architectural choices.

**Content Interpretation:**
The image illustrates the inference latency slow-down introduced by two types of adapter layers, AdapterH and AdapterL, under various operational parameters. Specifically, it shows how changes in sequence length ('Seq Len'), adapter rank ('r'), and batch size ('Batch Size') affect the percentage increase in inference time compared to a baseline without adapters.

The heatmaps represent the 'percentage slow-down of inference latency', which is a crucial metric for evaluating the efficiency of models with adapter layers. The color intensity visually signifies the magnitude of this slow-down, allowing for quick identification of performance bottlenecks. The 'r' parameter likely refers to the rank of the adapter layers, influencing their complexity and capacity.

The relationship being shown is the interaction between these three variables (sequence length, adapter rank, batch size) and their combined effect on inference latency. The visual evidence from the color gradients clearly depicts a trend: higher 'Seq Len' and 'Batch Size' values correlate with lower latency slow-down, while lower values in these parameters result in higher latency slow-down. The 'r' parameter also plays a role, with smaller 'r' values generally contributing to higher latency slow-down at lower batch sizes and sequence lengths.

Evidence from the text elements:
- **'Seq Len = 128', 'Seq Len = 256', 'Seq Len = 512'**: These labels define the different sequence lengths being tested, showing how latency changes with input size.
- **'Adapter^H r', 'Adapter^L r'**: These labels identify the two adapter architectures (H and L) and indicate that 'r' is a configurable parameter for these adapters, whose values (0, 10, 100, 250) are shown on the y-axis.
- **'Batch Size' (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32)**: These labels specify the different batch sizes used during inference, demonstrating their impact on latency.
- **Color bar labels (-35, -30, ..., 0)**: While numerically negative, the context clarifies these represent 'percentage slow-down'. The color gradient from dark purple (0) to light orange/pink (-35, implying 35% slowdown) provides a quantitative measure of latency increase.

The visual patterns, supported by these labels, demonstrate that both AdapterH and AdapterL exhibit similar sensitivities to the tested parameters, with optimal performance (minimal slowdown) achieved at higher sequence lengths and batch sizes.

**Key Insights:**
The main takeaways from this image, supported by the detailed textual and visual evidence, are:

1.  **Adapter Layers Introduce Inference Latency:** The presence of colored regions (not uniformly dark purple) across all heatmaps clearly indicates that both AdapterH and AdapterL introduce some degree of inference latency slow-down compared to a no-adapter baseline (r=0) in many scenarios. The color bar confirms that colors represent 'percentage slow-down'.

2.  **Batch Size and Sequence Length are Key Mitigation Factors:** The most striking insight is that increasing 'Batch Size' and 'Seq Len' significantly mitigates the inference latency slow-down. This is evidenced by:
    *   The clear progression from bright orange/pink (high slowdown) at 'Batch Size' 1 and 2 to dark purple (low/no slowdown) at 'Batch Size' 16 and 32, across all 'Seq Len' values and 'r' values.
    *   The change from significant slowdowns in the 'Seq Len = 128' column to predominantly dark purple in the 'Seq Len = 512' column for both adapter types, indicating that longer sequences reduce the relative latency overhead.

3.  **High Latency in 'Online, Short-Sequence-Length' Scenarios:** The image explicitly demonstrates that in scenarios with 'Seq Len = 128' and small 'Batch Size' (1 or 2), the 'percentage slow-down' can indeed be 'as high as over 30%', represented by the brightest orange/pink regions that correspond to the '-35' mark on the color bar (indicating a 35% slowdown). This is critical for real-world applications requiring low-latency responses for short inputs.

4.  **Impact of Adapter Rank ('r'):** For smaller 'Seq Len' and 'Batch Size', smaller 'r' values (0, 10, 100) tend to show higher latency slow-down. However, as 'Batch Size' and 'Seq Len' increase, the effect of 'r' becomes less prominent, with all 'r' values eventually leading to minimal slow-down (dark purple).

5.  **Similar Trends for AdapterH and AdapterL:** Both 'Adapter^H' (top row) and 'Adapter^L' (bottom row) exhibit qualitatively similar patterns regarding how 'Seq Len', 'r', and 'Batch Size' affect inference latency. While the exact magnitudes might differ slightly, the overall behavior and the factors that mitigate or exacerbate latency are consistent across both adapter types.

These insights are directly derived from the visual heatmaps and their corresponding axis labels and color bar, which quantitatively map the tested parameters to the observed latency slow-down.

**Document Context:**
This image is directly relevant to the 'B INFERENCE LATENCY INTRODUCED BY ADAPTER LAYERS' section of the document. It visually quantifies and explains the performance implications of integrating adapter layers into models, specifically focusing on inference speed. The document aims to analyze and present the trade-offs involved when using adapters, and this figure provides concrete data regarding the latency overhead.

The surrounding text already provides a high-level summary: 'Percentage slow-down of inference latency compared to the no-adapter ( r = 0 ) baseline. The top row shows the result for AdapterH and the bottom row AdapterL. Larger batch size and sequence length help to mitigate the latency, but the slow-down can be as high as over 30 % in an online, short-sequence-length scenario. We tweak the colormap for better visibility.'

The image serves as empirical evidence supporting these claims. It allows the reader to visually confirm that larger batch sizes and sequence lengths indeed lead to lower latency slowdowns, as indicated by the shift towards darker colors. Conversely, it vividly demonstrates the 'over 30%' slowdown for 'online, short-sequence-length scenario' (small batch size, small sequence length), aligning with the bright orange/pink regions in the 'Seq Len = 128' column for small batch sizes.

By presenting detailed heatmaps for different adapter types (AdapterH and AdapterL) and varying 'r' values, the image provides a granular view of latency behavior that complements the general statements in the text, allowing readers to understand the specific conditions under which adapters introduce significant latency. This makes the document's analysis of adapter layer overhead more comprehensive and data-driven.

**Summary:**
The image displays six heatmaps arranged in a 2x3 grid, visualizing the percentage slow-down of inference latency for two different adapter types (AdapterH and AdapterL) across varying sequence lengths, adapter ranks (r), and batch sizes. The color intensity indicates the magnitude of the slowdown, with darker purple representing 0% slowdown and lighter orange/pink representing up to 35% slowdown.

The top row of three heatmaps presents data for AdapterH, while the bottom row of three heatmaps presents data for AdapterL. Each column represents a different sequence length: 'Seq Len = 128' for the left column, 'Seq Len = 256' for the middle column, and 'Seq Len = 512' for the right column.

On the vertical axis of each row, labeled 'Adapter^H r' for the top row and 'Adapter^L r' for the bottom row, are four discrete values for the adapter rank 'r': 0, 10, 100, and 250. On the horizontal axis at the bottom of each column, labeled 'Batch Size', are six discrete values for batch size: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.

A vertical color bar on the far right of the entire figure serves as a legend for the percentage slow-down. It ranges from 0 (dark purple) to -35 (light orange/pink), with intermediate labels -5, -10, -15, -20, -25, -30. Despite the negative signs on the legend, the accompanying document text clarifies these values represent 'percentage slow-down', implying that a magnitude of 35 indicates a 35% slowdown.

Key observations from the heatmaps include a pronounced slow-down (indicated by bright orange/pink) for smaller 'Batch Size' values (1 and 2) and smaller 'r' values (0, 10, 100), particularly evident at 'Seq Len = 128'. As 'Seq Len' increases to 256 and then 512, and as 'Batch Size' increases, the slow-down generally diminishes significantly, with most areas becoming dark purple (0% slow-down). Both AdapterH and AdapterL show similar trends, but the specific magnitudes of slow-down may vary slightly between them. The overall pattern suggests that larger batch sizes and sequence lengths are effective in mitigating the latency introduced by adapter layers, while small batch sizes combined with short sequence lengths can lead to substantial latency increases.](images/3b249ac047bb910cc375d09c73389ecbc44d89039de67d2a0a247f227cdc217a.jpg)
Figure 5: Percentage slow-down of inference latency compared to the no-adapter $( r = 0$ ) baseline. The top row shows the result for AdapterH and the bottom row AdapterL. Larger batch size and sequence length help to mitigate the latency, but the slow-down can be as high as over $30 \%$ in an online, short-sequence-length scenario. We tweak the colormap for better visibility.

# C DATASET DETAILS

GLUE Benchmark is a wide-ranging collection of natural language understanding tasks. It includes MNLI (inference, Williams et al. (2018)), SST-2 (sentiment analysis, Socher et al. (2013)), MRPC (paraphrase detection, Dolan & Brockett (2005)), CoLA (linguistic acceptability, Warstadt et al. (2018)), QNLI (inference, Rajpurkar et al. (2018)), $\mathrm { Q Q P ^ { 8 } }$ (question-answering), RTE (inference), and STS-B (textual similarity, Cer et al. (2017)). The broad coverage makes GLUE benchmark a standard metric to evaluate NLU models such as RoBERTa and DeBERTa. The individual datasets are released under different permissive licenses.

WikiSQL is introduced in Zhong et al. (2017) and contains 56, 355/8, 421 training/validation examples. The task is to generate SQL queries from natural language questions and table schemata. We encode context as $x = \left\{ \begin{array} { l l } { \begin{array} { r l r l } \end{array} } \end{array} \right.$ {table schema, query} and target as $y = \{ \mathrm { S Q L } \}$ . The dataset is release under the BSD 3-Clause License.

SAMSum is introduced in Gliwa et al. (2019) and contains 14, 732/819 training/test examples. It consists of staged chat conversations between two people and corresponding abstractive summaries written by linguists. We encode context as $" \mathrm { \backslash n " }$ concatenated utterances followed by a $\ " \langle \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } \backslash \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } ^ { \prime \prime }$ , and target as $y = \{ \mathrm { s u m m a r y } \}$ . The dataset is released under the non-commercial licence: Creative Commons BY-NC-ND 4.0.

E2E NLG Challenge was first introduced in Novikova et al. (2017) as a dataset for training end-toend, data-driven natural language generation systems and is commonly used for data-to-text evaluation. The E2E dataset consists of roughly 42, 000 training, 4, 600 validation, and 4, 600 test examples from the restaurant domain. Each source table used as input can have multiple references. Each sample input $( x , y )$ consists of a sequence of slot-value pairs, along with a corresponding natural language reference text. The dataset is released under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0.

DART is an open-domain data-to-text dataset described in Nan et al. (2020). DART inputs are structured as sequences of ENTITY — RELATION — ENTITY triples. With $8 2 K$ examples in total, DART is a significantly larger and more complex data-to-text task compared to E2E. The dataset is released under the MIT license.

WebNLG is another commonly used dataset for data-to-text evaluation (Gardent et al., 2017). With $2 2 K$ examples in total WebNLG comprises 14 distinct categories, nine of which are seen during training. Since five of the 14 total categories are not seen during training, but are represented in the test set, evaluation is typically broken out by “seen” categories (S), “unseen” categories (U) and “all” (A). Each input example is represented by a sequence of SUBJECT — PROPERTY — OBJECT triples. The dataset is released under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0.

# D HYPERPARAMETERS USED IN EXPERIMENTS

# D.1 ROBERTA

We train using AdamW with a linear learning rate decay schedule. We sweep learning rate, number of training epochs, and batch size for LoRA. Following Liu et al. (2019), we initialize the LoRA modules to our best MNLI checkpoint when adapting to MRPC, RTE, and STS-B, instead of the usual initialization; the pre-trained model stays frozen for all tasks. We report the median over 5 random seeds; the result for each run is taken from the best epoch. For a fair comparison with the setup in Houlsby et al. (2019) and Pfeiffer et al. (2021), we restrict the model sequence length to 128 and used a fixed batch size for all tasks. Importantly, we start with the pre-trained RoBERTa large model when adapting to MRPC, RTE, and STS-B, instead of a model already adapted to MNLI. The runs with this restricted setup are marked with $\dagger$ . See the hyperparameters used in our runs in Table 9.

# D.2 DEBERTA

We again train using AdamW with a linear learning rate decay schedule. Following He et al. (2021), we tune learning rate, dropout probability, warm-up steps, and batch size. We use the same model sequence length used by (He et al., 2021) to keep our comparison fair. Following He et al. (2021), we initialize the LoRA modules to our best MNLI checkpoint when adapting to MRPC, RTE, and STS-B, instead of the usual initialization; the pre-trained model stays frozen for all tasks. We report the median over 5 random seeds; the result for each run is taken from the best epoch. See the hyperparameters used in our runs in Table 10.

# D.3 GPT-2

We train all of our GPT-2 models using AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017) with a linear learning rate schedule for 5 epochs. We use the batch size, learning rate, and beam search beam size described in Li & Liang (2021). Accordingly, we also tune the above hyperparameters for LoRA. We report the mean over 3 random seeds; the result for each run is taken from the best epoch. The hyperparameters used for LoRA in GPT-2 are listed in Table 11. For those used for other baselines, see Li & Liang (2021).

# D.4 GPT-3

For all GPT-3 experiments, we train using AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017) for 2 epochs with a batch size of 128 samples and a weight decay factor of 0.1. We use a sequence length of 384 for

WikiSQL (Zhong et al., 2017), 768 for MNLI (Williams et al., 2018), and 2048 for SAMSum (Gliwa et al., 2019). We tune learning rate for all method-dataset combinations. See Section D.4 for more details on the hyperparameters used. For prefix-embedding tuning, we find the optimal $l _ { p }$ and $l _ { i }$ to be 256 and 8, respectively, totalling $3 . 2 M$ trainable parameters. We use $l _ { p } = 8$ and $l _ { i } = 8$ for prefix-layer tuning with $2 0 . 2 M$ trainable parameters to obtain the overall best performance. We present two parameter budgets for LoRA: $4 . 7 \mathbf { M }$ $\gamma _ { q } = r _ { v } = 1$ or $r _ { v } = 2$ ) and 37.7M $( r _ { q } = r _ { v } = 8 $ or $r _ { q } = r _ { k } = r _ { v } = r _ { o } = 2 $ ). We report the best validation performance from each run. The training hyperparameters used in our GPT-3 experiments are listed in Table 12.

# E COMBINING LORA WITH PREFIX TUNING

LoRA can be naturally combined with existing prefix-based approaches. In this section, we evaluate two combinations of LoRA and variants of prefix-tuning on WikiSQL and MNLI.

LoRA $^ +$ PrefixEmbed $\mathbf { ( L o R A + P E }$ ) combines LoRA with prefix-embedding tuning, where we insert $l _ { p } + l _ { i }$ special tokens whose embeddings are treated as trainable parameters. For more on prefixembedding tuning, see Section 5.1.

LoRA $^ +$ PrefixLayer $\mathbf { ( L o R A + P L }$ ) combines LoRA with prefix-layer tuning. We also insert $l _ { p } + l _ { i }$ special tokens; however, instead of letting the hidden representations of these tokens evolve naturally, we replace them after every Transformer block with an input agnostic vector. Thus, both the embeddings and subsequent Transformer block activations are treated as trainable parameters. For more on prefix-layer tuning, see Section 5.1.

Table 12: The training hyperparameters used for different GPT-3 adaption methods. We use the same hyperparameters for all datasets after tuning learning rate.

In Table 15, we show the evaluation results of $\mathrm { L o R A + P E }$ and $\mathrm { L o R A + P L }$ on WikiSQL and MultiNLI. First of all, $\mathrm { L o R A + P E }$ significantly outperforms both LoRA and prefix-embedding tuning on WikiSQL, which indicates that LoRA is somewhat orthogonal to prefix-embedding tuning. On MultiNLI, the combination of $\mathrm { L o R A + P E }$ doesn’t perform better than LoRA, possibly because LoRA on its own already achieves performance comparable to the human baseline. Secondly, we notice that $\mathrm { L o R A + P L }$ performs slightly worse than LoRA even with more trainable parameters. We attribute this to the fact that prefix-layer tuning is very sensitive to the choice of learning rate and thus makes the optimization of LoRA weights more difficult in $\mathrm { L o R A + P L }$ .

# F ADDITIONAL EMPIRICAL EXPERIMENTS

# F.1 ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS ON GPT-2

We also repeat our experiment on DART (Nan et al., 2020) and WebNLG (Gardent et al., 2017) following the setup of Li & Liang (2021). The result is shown in Table 13. Similar to our result on E2E NLG Challenge, reported in Section 5, LoRA performs better than or at least on-par with prefix-based approaches given the same number of trainable parameters.

# F.2 ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS ON GPT-3

We present additional runs on GPT-3 with different adaptation methods in Table 15. The focus is on identifying the trade-off between performance and the number of trainable parameters.

# F.3 LOW-DATA REGIME

To evaluate the performance of different adaptation approaches in the low-data regime. we randomly sample 100, 1k and $1 0 \mathrm { k }$ training examples from the full training set of MNLI to form the low-data MNLI- $\boldsymbol { n }$ tasks. In Table 16, we show the performance of different adaptation approaches on MNLI$n$ . To our surprise, PrefixEmbed and PrefixLayer performs very poorly on MNLI-100 dataset, with PrefixEmbed performing only slightly better than random chance $( 3 7 . 6 \%$ vs. $3 3 . 3 \%$ ). PrefixLayer performs better than PrefixEmbed but is still significantly worse than Fine-Tune or LoRA on MNLI100. The gap between prefix-based approaches and LoRA/Fine-tuning becomes smaller as we increase the number of training examples, which might suggest that prefix-based approaches are not suitable for low-data tasks in GPT-3. LoRA achieves better performance than fine-tuning on both MNLI-100 and MNLI-Full, and comparable results on MNLI-1k and MNLI-10K considering the $\left( \pm 0 . 3 \right)$ variance due to random seeds.

The training hyperparameters of different adaptation approaches on MNLI-n are reported in Table 17. We use a smaller learning rate for PrefixLayer on the MNLI-100 set, as the training loss does not decrease with a larger learning rate.

# G MEASURING SIMILARITY BETWEEN SUBSPACES

In this paper we use the measure φ(A, B, i, j) = ψ(U iA, U jB ) = kUi>A UBk2Fmin{i,j} t o measure the subspace similarity between two column orthonormal matrices $U _ { A } ^ { i } \in \mathbb { R } ^ { d \times i }$ and $U _ { B } ^ { j } \in \mathbb { R } ^ { d \times j }$ , obtained by taking columns of the left singular matrices of $A$ and $B$ . We point out that this similarity is simply a reverse of the standard Projection Metric that measures distance between subspaces Ham & Lee (2008).

Table 15: Hyperparameter analysis of different adaptation approaches on WikiSQL and MNLI. Both prefix-embedding tuning (PrefixEmbed) and prefix-layer tuning (PrefixLayer) perform worse as we increase the number of trainable parameters, while LoRA’s performance stabilizes. Performance is measured in validation accuracy.

To be concrete, let the singular values of $U _ { A } ^ { i \top } U _ { B } ^ { j }$ to be $\sigma _ { 1 } , \sigma _ { 2 } , \cdots , \sigma _ { p }$ where $p = \operatorname* { m i n } \{ i , j \}$ . We know that the Projection Metric Ham & Lee (2008) is defined as:

where our similarity is defined as:

This similarity satisfies that if $U _ { A } ^ { i }$ and $U _ { B } ^ { j }$ share the same column span, then $\phi ( A , B , i , j ) = 1$ . If they are completely orthogonal, then $\phi ( \tilde { A , { B , i , j } } ) = 0$ . Otherwise, $\phi ( A , B , i , j ) \in ( 0 , 1 )$ .

# H ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS ON LOW-RANK MATRICES

We present additional results from our investigation into the low-rank update matrices.

# H.1 CORRELATION BETWEEN LORA MODULES

See Figure 6 and Figure 7 for how the results presented in Figure 3 and Figure 4 generalize to other layers.

# H.2 EFFECT OF $r$ ON GPT-2

We repeat our experiment on the effect of $r$ (Section 7.2) in GPT-2. Using the E2E NLG Challenge dataset as an example, we report the validation loss and test metrics achieved by different choices of $r$ after training for 26,000 steps. We present our result in Table 18. The optimal rank for GPT-2 Medium is between 4 and 16 depending on the metric used, which is similar to that for GPT-3 175B. Note that the relationship between model size and the optimal rank for adaptation is still an open question.

# H.3 CORRELATION BETWEEN $W$ AND $\Delta W$

See Figure 8 for the normalized subspace similarity between $W$ and $\Delta W$ with varying $r$

Note again that $\Delta W$ does not contain the top singular directions of $W$ , since the similarity between the top 4 directions in $\Delta W$ and the top- $10 \%$ of those in $W$ barely exceeds 0.2. This gives evidence that $\Delta W$ contains those “task-specific” directions that are otherwise not emphasized in $W$ .

An interesting next question to answer, is how “strong” do we need to amplify those task-specific directions, in order for the model adaptation to work well?

![## Image Analysis: 830d565ee3523f4b2032bb34d37619bca910bdb7f66c17159ce409689dc23f7f.jpg

**Conceptual Understanding:**
This image conceptually represents the 'normalized subspace similarity' between two sets of column vectors, specifically those derived from $A_{r=8}$ and $A_{r=64}$, which are likely related to different ranks or representations of the weight matrices within a Transformer. The main purpose is to visualize and analyze how changes in query weights ($\Delta W_q$) and value weights ($\Delta W_v$) in a deep learning Transformer model exhibit these subspace similarities across different architectural layers. The grid structure allows for a systematic comparison across four distinct layers (1, 32, 64, 96) and two types of weight changes. The distinct patterns observed in the heatmaps aim to convey insights into the internal workings and representational properties of Transformer models during learning, particularly concerning how different components and layers contribute to or reflect these subspace similarities.

**Content Interpretation:**
The image visualizes the normalized subspace similarity, $\phi(A_r=8, A_r=64, i, j)$, which measures the similarity between column vectors of two matrices, $A_{r=8}$ and $A_{r=64}$. This similarity is presented for changes in weights, $\Delta W_q$ (query weights) and $\Delta W_v$ (value weights), within a Transformer model. The data is segmented by specific layers of a 96-layer Transformer (Layer 1, 32, 64, 96) and by two different forms of comparison (rectangular heatmaps and triangular heatmaps). The rectangular heatmaps (first two columns) show similarities across a larger range of 'j' indices (1-58), while the triangular heatmaps (last two columns) show similarities across a smaller range of 'j' indices (1-8), likely indicating internal component similarities or a different scope of comparison. The color gradient from 0.0 (low similarity) to 1.0 (high similarity) allows for immediate visual assessment of these relationships. The consistent 'i' values from 1 to 8 across all heatmaps suggest a fixed dimension or component count for one of the comparison axes.

**Key Insights:**
**1. Layer-Dependent Similarity Patterns:** The similarity patterns vary significantly across different Transformer layers. For instance, 'Layer 1' and 'Layer 64' (both for $\Delta W_q$ and $\Delta W_v$) tend to exhibit higher similarity values (more orange/red) across broader regions in the rectangular heatmaps compared to 'Layer 32' and 'Layer 96', which show more muted or localized high similarities (more purple/darker shades). This suggests that the initial and mid-range layers might have more pronounced subspace similarities in their weight changes compared to deeper layers or specific intermediate layers. **2. Distinct Comparison Scopes:** The presence of both rectangular (larger 'j' range: 1-58) and triangular (smaller 'j' range: 1-8) heatmaps highlights that the subspace similarity is being analyzed under different comparison scopes or contexts for 'i' and 'j' indices. The triangular shape in the third and fourth columns implies a specific relationship between 'i' and 'j', possibly $i \ge j$ or $i \le j$, which is common in comparisons of elements within a self-referential or ordered set, like attention heads or sub-components. **3. Differential Similarity for $\Delta W_q$ vs $\Delta W_v$:** While both $\Delta W_q$ and $\Delta W_v$ generally follow similar trends within a given layer and comparison type, subtle differences in the intensity and distribution of high-similarity regions can be observed. This suggests that the changes in query and value weights, while related, may not have identical subspace similarity characteristics. **4. High Similarity Regions:** Across various heatmaps, especially in 'Layer 1' and 'Layer 64' for the rectangular plots, there are distinct blocks or gradients of high similarity (values approaching 1.0), particularly in the upper-left regions. For the triangular heatmaps, higher similarities are often observed closer to the diagonal (where 'i' and 'j' values are closer), indicating a stronger correlation or similarity among closely indexed components. The specific text labels for 'Layer 1', 'Layer 32', 'Layer 64', 'Layer 96', '$\\Delta W_q$', '$\\Delta W_v$', and the ranges of 'i' (1-8) and 'j' (1-58 or 1-8) are crucial for understanding these specific findings.

**Document Context:**
This image is presented in the document section 'H.3 CORRELATION BETWEEN $W$ AND $\Delta W$', and the text immediately following the image explicitly states: 'Figure 6: Normalized subspace similarity between the column vectors of $A_{r=8}$ and $A_{r=64}$ for both $\Delta W_q$ and $\Delta W_v$ from the 1st, 32nd, 64th, and 96th layers in a 96-layer Transformer.' This context confirms that the figure is a direct visualization of the described similarity metric and its application to different weight changes and layers within a Transformer architecture. The image serves to provide empirical evidence and visual insights into how the changes in query and value weights in different layers of a Transformer correlate with specific subspace similarities, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics of model training and representation learning.

**Summary:**
The image displays a 4x4 grid of heatmaps, illustrating the normalized subspace similarity, denoted by $\phi$, between column vectors of $A_{r=8}$ and $A_{r=64}$, across different layers of a 96-layer Transformer and for different types of weight changes ($\\Delta W_q$ and $\\Delta W_v$). Each heatmap uses a color scale ranging from 0.0 (dark purple) to 1.0 (bright orange/red), indicating the degree of similarity. The grid is organized by Transformer layer on the vertical axis (rows) and by the type of weight change on the horizontal axis (columns). The first two columns present full rectangular heatmaps where the 'j' index spans a wider range, while the last two columns present triangular heatmaps where the 'j' index spans a narrower range, suggesting a comparison of components within a smaller, fixed dimension. The values for 'i' consistently range from 1 to 8, while 'j' varies based on the type of comparison. The heatmaps generally show a range of similarity values, with higher similarities often appearing in the upper-left regions of the rectangular heatmaps and in the regions where 'i' and 'j' values are closer in the triangular heatmaps, particularly for 'Layer 1' and 'Layer 64' for $\\Delta W_q$ and $\\Delta W_v$.](images/830d565ee3523f4b2032bb34d37619bca910bdb7f66c17159ce409689dc23f7f.jpg)

# H.4 AMPLIFICATION FACTOR

One can naturally consider a feature amplification factor as the ratio k∆WkFkU>W V >kF , where U and V are the left- and right-singular matrices of the SVD decomposition of $\Delta W$ . (Recall $U U ^ { \top } W V ^ { \top } V$ gives the “projection” of $W$ onto the subspace spanned by $\Delta W$ .)

Intuitively, when $\Delta W$ mostly contains task-specific directions, this quantity measures how much of them are amplified by $\Delta W$ . As shown in Section 7.3, for $r = 4$ , this amplification factor is as large as 20. In other words, there are (generally speaking) four feature directions in each layer (out of the entire feature space from the pre-trained model $W$ ), that need to be amplified by a very large factor 20, in order to achieve our reported accuracy for the downstream specific task. And, one should expect a very different set of feature directions to be amplified for each different downstream task.

One may notice, however, for $r \ = \ 6 4$ , this amplification factor is only around 2, meaning that most directions learned in $\Delta W$ with $r \ : = \ : 6 4$ are not being amplified by much. This should not be surprising, and in fact gives evidence (once again) that the intrinsic rank needed to represent the “task-specific directions” (thus for model adaptation) is low. In contrast, those directions in the rank-4 version of $\Delta W$ (corresponding to $r = 4$ ) are amplified by a much larger factor 20.

**Conceptual Understanding:**
This image represents a visual analysis of the stability or consistency of learned features within a Transformer neural network. Specifically, it illustrates the 'normalized subspace similarity' between corresponding column vectors of weight matrices ($\Delta W_q$ and $\Delta W_v$) from two distinct, randomly initialized training runs. The heatmaps allow researchers to observe how this similarity metric changes across different layers of the network (Layer 1, 32, 64, 96) and for different vector indices (i, j). The main purpose is to quantify and visualize the agreement or disagreement in the learned subspaces spanned by these vectors when the training process starts with different random seeds. Essentially, it's exploring the reproducibility and convergence characteristics of specific components of the learned weight matrices in a deep learning model.

**Content Interpretation:**
The image displays eight heatmaps illustrating the normalized subspace similarity of column vectors from $A_{r=64}$ and $A'_{r=64}$ (presumably from two different randomly seeded runs of a Transformer model). The data is presented for two types of weight matrix changes, $\Delta W_q$ and $\Delta W_v$, and for four distinct layers: 1, 32, 64, and 96 within a 96-layer Transformer. Each heatmap is a matrix where the x and y axes represent indices 'i' and 'j', respectively, ranging from 1 to 61. The color intensity within each cell (i, j) indicates the similarity value, as per the provided color bar ranging from 0.0 to 0.8.

The dominant visual feature across all heatmaps is a bright, high-similarity band along the top-left diagonal (where i and j are small), transitioning to much lower similarity values (dark purple/black) as i and j increase. This suggests that the initial (lower-indexed) column vectors of the weight matrices from different runs maintain higher subspace similarity compared to later (higher-indexed) vectors, or that similarity is highest when comparing vectors from similar indices across runs.

**Key Insights:**
1.  **High Initial Subspace Similarity:** The most prominent insight is that the subspace similarity (represented by the brighter, red/orange colors) is consistently high for low indices of 'i' and 'j' across all tested layers (1, 32, 64, 96) and both weight types ($\Delta W_q$, $\Delta W_v$). This is evident from the bright diagonal region in the top-left corner of each heatmap, where 'i' and 'j' values are small (e.g., from 1 to approximately 10-15).
2.  **Decreasing Similarity with Increasing Indices:** As the indices 'i' and 'j' increase (moving away from the top-left corner towards the bottom-right), the similarity values generally decrease significantly, becoming very low (dark purple/black, near 0.0). This suggests that the column vectors corresponding to higher indices exhibit much less consistent subspace similarity between different randomly seeded runs.
3.  **Consistency Across Layers and Weight Types:** The general pattern of high similarity at low indices and low similarity at high indices is largely consistent across all four depicted layers (Layer 1, Layer 32, Layer 64, Layer 96) and both types of weight matrix changes ($\Delta W_q$ and $\Delta W_v$). This implies that the observed phenomenon is a robust characteristic of the Transformer's learning process, rather than being specific to a particular layer or weight type.
4.  **Implications for Learned Representations:** The findings suggest that the initial or 'early' components (represented by low indices) of the learned weight changes are more stable and consistent across different random initializations, while later components are more variable. This could have implications for understanding which parts of the model's learned features are robust and which are more susceptible to random factors during training.

**Document Context:**
This image is crucial for understanding the 'AMPLIFICATION FACTOR' section, as indicated by the document context. It visualizes the consistency and variability of certain learned representations (specifically, column vectors of weight matrices) within a Transformer model across different training runs and layers. The figure directly supports the accompanying text, which states, 'Figure 7: Normalized subspace similarity between the column vectors of $A _ { r = 6 4 }$ from two randomly seeded runs, for both $\Delta W _ { q }$ and $\Delta W _ { v }$ from the 1st, 32nd, 64th, and 96th layers in a 96-layer Transformer.' It provides empirical evidence for how the subspace similarity of query ($\Delta W_q$) and value ($\Delta W_v$) weight changes evolve or persist across different layers of a deep neural network, especially when considering different random initializations. The patterns observed, particularly the high similarity at low indices, would be key to discussing the stability or sensitivity of the learned features.

**Summary:**
This image displays a grid of eight heatmaps, each illustrating the normalized subspace similarity between column vectors from two randomly seeded runs of a Transformer model. The heatmaps are organized into two rows and four columns, representing different layers and weight types. The top-level title for the entire grid is '$\phi(A_{r=64}, A'_{r=64}, i, j)$', indicating a similarity function applied to matrices A and A' with rank 64, considering indices i and j.

Each heatmap's y-axis is labeled 'i' and its x-axis is labeled 'j'. The y-axis ticks for the left-hand side heatmaps (Layer 1 and Layer 64) show values: 1, 7, 13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43, 49, 55, 61. The x-axis ticks for the bottom row heatmaps (Layer 64 and Layer 96) show values: 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31, 36, 41, 46, 51, 56, 61.

The rows of heatmaps represent different layers of the Transformer: 'Layer 1' for the top row left two heatmaps, 'Layer 32' for the top row right two heatmaps, 'Layer 64' for the bottom row left two heatmaps, and 'Layer 96' for the bottom row right two heatmaps.

The columns of heatmaps distinguish between two types of weight matrices, $\Delta W_q$ and $\Delta W_v$. Specifically, the first and third columns (from the left) correspond to $\Delta W_q$, while the second and fourth columns correspond to $\Delta W_v$.

A color bar on the far right of the image provides the scale for the similarity values, ranging from 0.0 (dark purple/black) to 0.8 (light orange/red). The specific tick values on the color bar are: -0.8, -0.7, -0.6, -0.5, -0.4, -0.3, -0.2, -0.1, 0.0. The values shown in the heatmaps indicate that similarity ranges from 0.0 to 0.8, with higher values represented by lighter colors (orange/red) and lower values by darker colors (purple/black). The heatmaps predominantly show a dark purple/black region with a bright orange/red stripe along the top-left diagonal, indicating higher similarity values along this specific axis combination.

In summary, the figure presents a detailed view of how the subspace similarity of weight matrix column vectors varies across different layers and for different types of weight matrices ($\Delta W_q$ and $\Delta W_v$) within a Transformer architecture.](images/34dc5ff61776ebde186cc291eb7a361030857c34bc707151c31f7031a9a1c8aa.jpg)

Table 18: Validation loss and test set metrics on E2E NLG Challenge achieved by LoRA with different rank $r$ using GPT-2 Medium. Unlike on GPT-3 where $r = 1$ suffices for many tasks, here the performance peaks at $r = 1 6$ for validation loss and $r = 4$ for BLEU, suggesting the GPT-2 Medium has a similar intrinsic rank for adaptation compared to GPT-3 175B. Note that some of our hyperparameters are tuned on $r = 4$ , which matches the parameter count of another baseline, and thus might not be optimal for other choices of $r$ .

**Conceptual Understanding:**
This image represents a comparative analysis of 'normalized subspace similarity' (denoted as $\\phi$) between singular directions. Conceptually, it illustrates how a transformation or modification, specifically $\\Delta W_q$ with varying parameters ('r'), affects the alignment or commonality between sets of singular directions ($W_q$ and the modified $A_r$). The main purpose is to demonstrate the impact of the amplification factor 'r' on this similarity, contrasting it with a random baseline. It communicates how increasing 'r' leads to a greater number or range of directions exhibiting higher similarity, suggesting an amplification effect that brings more directions into alignment or emphasis.

**Content Interpretation:**
The image presents four heatmaps visualizing subspace similarity (denoted by $\\phi$) between the singular directions of $W_q$ and those of $\\Delta W_q$ (for the first three heatmaps) or a random baseline (for the fourth heatmap). The variable '$r$' (from $A_r$) is varied across the first three heatmaps as 4, 8, and 64, which appears to be a parameter influencing the $\\Delta W_q$ component. The 'i' and 'j' axes likely represent indices or dimensions of the singular directions being compared. The color scale indicates the magnitude of the similarity, with darker colors representing lower similarity and lighter/orange colors representing higher similarity.

The first three heatmaps demonstrate a clear pattern where similarity values generally increase as both '$i$' and '$j$' increase. The extent of the higher similarity (orange regions) expands with increasing '$r$' (4, 8, then 64). Specifically, for $A_r=4$, the higher similarity is concentrated more in the bottom-right corner. For $A_r=8$, this region extends a bit more. For $A_r=64$, the high similarity region covers a significantly larger portion of the bottom area, extending to lower '$j$' values even at higher '$i$' values. This suggests that as '$r$' increases, $\\Delta W_q$ tends to emphasize directions that have higher similarity with the directions from $W_q$, or perhaps that larger '$r$' values lead to a broader range of high-similarity directions.

In contrast, the fourth heatmap, 'Random $\\phi(W_q, A_{rand}, i, j)$', shows uniformly low similarity values across all '$i$' and '$j$', appearing almost entirely dark purple. This serves as a baseline, confirming that the patterns observed in the first three heatmaps are not random and are specific to the $\\Delta W_q$ component and its parameter '$r$'. The low similarity in the random case indicates that without the specific $\\Delta W_q$ construction, there is no inherent alignment or similarity between the singular directions.

**Key Insights:**
The main takeaways from this image, supported by the visual patterns and textual labels, are:
1.  **Non-random amplification:** The structured patterns of subspace similarity observed with $\\Delta W_q$ are not random, as evidenced by the uniformly low similarity in the 'Random' baseline heatmap. This confirms that $\\Delta W_q$ introduces specific, non-random relationships between singular directions.
2.  **Influence of parameter 'r'**: The parameter '$r$' in $A_r$ significantly affects the amplification. As '$r$' increases from 4 to 8 to 64, the region of high subspace similarity (indicated by warmer colors) expands, particularly towards higher values of '$i$' and '$j$'. This visually supports the idea that larger '$r$' values lead to $\\Delta W_q$ picking up more directions that are 'important' or 'emphasized'.
3.  **Directional preference in similarity**: For non-random cases, there is a clear trend for subspace similarity to be higher for larger values of '$i$' and '$j$'. This suggests that the 'important' or 'emphasized' directions, which are amplified by $\\Delta W_q$, tend to correspond to higher indices '$i$' and '$j$' in this context. The exact meaning of '$i$' and '$j$' (e.g., singular value indices) would be crucial for a deeper interpretation.

**Document Context:**
This image directly supports the document's discussion in Section H.4, 'AMPLIFICATION FACTOR'. The text after the image, 'Figure 8: Normalized subspace similarity between the singular directions of $W _ { q }$ and those of $\Delta W _ { q }$ with varying $r$ and a random baseline. $\Delta W _ { q }$ amplifies directions that are important but not emphasized in $W$ . $\Delta W$ with a larger $r$ tends to pick up more directions that are already emphasized in $W$ .', explicitly links the visual data to the concepts of amplification and emphasized directions.

The heatmaps visually demonstrate how $\\Delta W_q$ (with varying '$r$') influences the subspace similarity. The increasing spread of higher similarity values with larger '$r$' (from 4 to 64) graphically illustrates the statement '$\\Delta W$ with a larger $r$ tends to pick up more directions that are already emphasized in $W$'. The 'Random' baseline heatmap provides crucial evidence by showing a lack of similarity without the $\\Delta W_q$ amplification, reinforcing that the observed patterns are a direct result of the amplification factor. Therefore, the image serves as empirical evidence for the theoretical claims about the amplification properties of $\\Delta W_q$.

**Summary:**
This image consists of four heatmaps arranged horizontally, each depicting subspace similarity values using a color gradient from dark purple (lower values) to light orange (higher values). The values range from approximately 0.100 to 0.200, as indicated by the color bar on the right. All heatmaps share the same y-axis labeled '$i$' with tick marks at 451, 555, 658, 762, 865, 969, 1072, and 1176. Each heatmap also has an x-axis labeled '$j$'.

The first heatmap is titled '$\\phi(W_q, A_r=4, i, j)$'. It shows values increasing as '$i$' increases and '$j$' increases, with a clear gradient from dark purple in the top-left to orange in the bottom-right.

The second heatmap is titled '$\\Delta W_q$' above it and '$\\phi(W_q, A_r=8, i, j)$' below '$\\Delta W_q$'. This heatmap exhibits a similar trend to the first, with values increasing from top-left to bottom-right, but it appears to have slightly higher values or a steeper gradient towards the bottom-right compared to the first heatmap, especially around the mid-range of '$j$'.

The third heatmap is titled '$\\phi(W_q, A_r=64, i, j)$'. This heatmap shows a more pronounced increase in values towards the bottom-right. The orange region extends further upwards and leftwards compared to the first two heatmaps, suggesting generally higher similarity values for a wider range of '$i$' and '$j$' for this 'A_r' value.

The fourth heatmap is titled 'Random' above it and '$\\phi(W_q, A_{rand}, i, j)$' below 'Random'. This heatmap is predominantly dark purple, indicating very low similarity values across all '$i$' and '$j$' coordinates, close to the minimum value of 0.100 on the color scale. This suggests a lack of the structured patterns observed in the other three heatmaps.](images/5c8467a53fe21d445aa7cc8787cfb1677ef376bfc4f305f1b5a40bacf0f79d09.jpg)
