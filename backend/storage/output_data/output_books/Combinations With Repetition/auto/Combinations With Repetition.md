Combinations represent the number of different possible ways we can pick a number of elements. In special cases we can have repetition in combinations and for those we use a different formula.

Now that you know what the formula looks like, we are going to walk you through the process of deriving this formula from the Combinations without repetition formula. This way you will be able to fully understand the intuition behind and not have to bother memorizing it.

To understand how combinations with repetition work you need to understand the instances where they occur.

We use combinations with repetition when the events we are dealing with, have sufficient quantity of each of the distinct values in the sample space.

One such example is the toppings on a pizza.

We can order extra of any given topping, so repetition is allowed. However, we do not care about the order in which the toppings are put on top of the pizza, so we cannot use variations.

Similar examples include picking the ice-cream flavours for a Sundae melt or the players for a Fantasy Football Team.

**Conceptual Understanding:**
This image conceptually represents two popular food items: a slice of pizza and an ice cream cone. The main purpose of these icons is to visually identify or symbolize these particular foods in a clear and minimalistic manner. It conveys the idea of a 'pizza' (specifically a slice) and an 'ice cream' (in a cone) through their universally recognized shapes, without additional detail or context.

**Content Interpretation:**
The image presents two common food items: a slice of pizza and an ice cream cone. These are depicted as simple, stylized black silhouettes. The pizza slice is characterized by its triangular shape, a curved crust, and three abstract circular toppings. The ice cream cone shows a rounded scoop of ice cream on top of a textured cone. The significance is purely illustrative, representing these food items in a universally recognizable iconographic format. All interpretations are based solely on the visual shapes as there is no textual information to support or elaborate on their meaning.

**Key Insights:**
The main takeaway from this image is the visual representation of two distinct food items: pizza and ice cream. It highlights how these items can be recognized through simplified, universal iconography. There are no deeper insights, conclusions, or lessons to be extracted beyond the identification of the objects, as no textual information, data, or complex relationships are presented to provide further meaning. The 'evidence' for these insights is solely the clear visual depiction of the objects themselves.

**Document Context:**
Given the absence of document context, the image likely serves as a visual placeholder, an icon for categories of food (savory vs. sweet, main course vs. dessert), or part of a larger graphic design element. It could be used in a menu, a presentation about food preferences, or a simple representation of different meal components. Without surrounding text, its specific role in a document cannot be determined, but its general purpose would be to visually communicate 'pizza' and 'ice cream' concepts.

**Summary:**
The image displays two distinct black silhouette icons against a white background. On the left, there is an icon of a pizza slice, depicted as a triangle with a curved crust line at the top and three circular shapes within it representing toppings (two full circles and one crescent-shaped circle near the tip). On the right, there is an icon of an ice cream cone, showing a scoop of ice cream with a wavy bottom edge, placed atop a triangular cone with two diagonal lines indicating texture or divisions. There is no text, annotations, or metadata present in this image.](images/6371c4dd9aeff62f5a4ad99b4cea42f4d55d6a77dc7b7997a219cd115fb96883.jpg)

To get a better grasp of the number of combinations we have, let us explore a specific example.

You are ordering a 3-topping pizza from your local pizza place but they only have 6 topping left because its late.

The toppings are as follows:   
cheddar cheese, onions, green peppers, mushrooms, pepperoni and bacon.

Your pizza can have 3 different toppings, or you can repeat a topping up to 3 times.

You can either order a pizza with 3 different toppings, a pizza with 3 identical toppings or a pizza with 2 different toppings but having a double dose of one of them.

**Conceptual Understanding:**
This image conceptually represents a single serving of pizza. Its main purpose is to serve as a recognizable visual icon for pizza, food, or a meal. The stylized nature indicates it's likely intended for digital interfaces, infographics, or simple illustrative purposes where a clear, unambiguous symbol is required.

**Content Interpretation:**
The image represents a stylized, minimalist icon of a single slice of pizza. It visually conveys the concept of pizza or a portion of it. The black shape forms the body of the slice, with the curved top acting as the crust. The white line further delineates the crust, and the white circles and semi-circle symbolize toppings. The image does not depict any processes, relationships, or complex systems, but rather a simple object.

**Key Insights:**
The primary takeaway from this image is the visual identification of a pizza slice. No complex knowledge, patterns, or insights beyond this basic recognition can be extracted, as it is a simple, unannotated icon. The key insight is merely the clear representation of its subject matter.

**Document Context:**
Without additional document context, the specific relevance of this image is unknown. However, as a standalone icon, it typically signifies themes related to food, dining, Italian cuisine, or possibly a 'pizza party' in a broader narrative. It could be used as a simple visual marker or placeholder for these concepts.

**Summary:**
The image displays a monochrome icon of a single slice of pizza. The slice is depicted in solid black, with a slightly curved top edge representing the crust. A thin, horizontal white line separates the crust area from the main body of the pizza slice. Three white circular shapes are visible on the black body of the pizza, representing toppings. Two larger white circles are positioned in the upper part of the slice, one towards the left and one towards the right. A smaller, semicircular white shape is located near the bottom point of the slice, suggesting a partially visible topping or a stylised element. The overall shape of the slice is a triangle with a curved top edge. There is no other text, numbers, or symbols present in the image.](images/121f50eeece0d62f2d88a2e005a7472ae58469e4e213a4544eaebba9443ff679.jpg)

The methodology we use for such combinations is rather abstract. We like to represent each type of pizza with a special sequence of 0s and 1s. To do so, we first need to select a specific order for the available ingredients.

We can reuse the order we wrote down earlier: cheddar cheese, onions, green peppers, mushrooms, pepperoni and bacon.

For convenience we can refer to each ingredient by the associated letter we have highlighted (e.g “c” means cheese, and “o” means onions).

To construct the sequence for each unique type of pizza we follow 2 rules as we go through the ingredients in the order we wrote down earlier.

If we want no more from a certain topping, we write a 0 and move to the next topping.

If we want to include a certain topping, we write a 1 and stay on the same topping.

Not going to the next topping allows us to indicate if we want extra by adding another 1, before we move forward. Say, if we want our pizza to have extra cheese, the sequence would begin with “1, 1”. Also, we always apply rule 1 before moving on to another topping, so the sequence will actually start with “1, 1, $0 ^ { \prime \prime }$ .

If we need to write a $" 0 "$ after each topping, then every sequence would consist of 6 zeroes and 3 ones.

Let’s look at some pizzas and the sequences they are expressed with.

A pizza with cheese and extra peperoni is represented by the sequence 1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.

A vegan variety pizza with onions, green peppers and mushrooms would be represented by the sequence 0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0.

Now, what kind of pizza would the sequence 0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0 represent?

We can put the sequence into the table and see that it represents a cheese pizza with extra bacon.

<table><tr><td>C</td><td>0</td><td>G</td><td>M</td><td>P</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>1,0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1,1,00</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>1,0</td><td>1,0</td><td>1,0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1,0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1,1,0</td></tr></table>

Notice how all the sequences we have examined end on a 0:

• 1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0   
0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0   
0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

This is no coincidence, since according to rule 1 of our algorithm, we need to add a $" 0 "$ at the end of the sequence, regardless of whether we wanted bacon or not.

That means that only the first 8 elements of the sequence can take different values.

Each pizza is characterized by the positions of the 3 “1”s in the sequence. Since only 8 of the positions in the sequence can take a value of “1”, then the number of different pizzas would be the combination of any 3 of the 8 positions.

<table><tr><td>C</td><td></td><td>G</td><td>M</td><td>P</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>1,0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1,1,0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>1,0</td><td>1,0</td><td>1,0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1,0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1,1,0</td></tr></table>

As stated before, we have 3 “1s” and 8 different positions. Therefore, the number of pizzas we can get would be the number of combinations of picking 3 elements out of a set of 8. This means we can transform combinations with repetition to combinations without repetition.

$$
\bar { C } ( 6 , 3 ) = \mathrm { C } ( 8 , 3 )
$$

Let’s observe the values 3 and 8 for a moment and try to generalize the formula. $" 3 "$ represents the amount of toppings we need to pick, so it is still equivalent to p.

$" 8 "$ represents the number of positions we have available for the ones. We had $3 + 6 ,$ or 9 positions in total, but we knew the last one could not contain a “1”. Thus, we had ${ } ^ { \prime \prime } \mathsf { n } + \mathsf { p } - \mathsf { \mathsf { 1 } } ^ { \prime \prime }$ many positions that could contain a 1.

Now that we know the relationship between the number of combinations with and without repetition, we can plug in $\mathrm { \hbar } { + } \mathsf { p } { - } 1 ^ { \prime \prime }$ into the combinations without repetitio formula to get:

$$
\operatorname { \mathfrak { I } } ( { \mathfrak { n } } + { \mathfrak { p } } - 1 , { \mathfrak { p } } ) = { \frac { ( { \mathfrak { n } } + { \mathfrak { p } } - 1 ) ! } { ( ( { \mathfrak { n } } + { \mathfrak { p } } - 1 ) - { \mathfrak { p } } ) ! } }
$$

This is the exact same formula we showed you at the beginning.   
Before we you continue to the next lecture, let’s make a quick recap of the algorithm and the formula.

1. We started by ordering the possible values and expressing every combinations as a sequence.   
2. We examined that only certain elements of the sequence may differ.   
3. We concluded that every unique sequence can be expressed as a combination of the positions of the   
“1” values.   
4. We discovered a relationship between the formulas for combinations with and without repetition.   
5. We used said relationship to create a general formula for combinations with repetition.
